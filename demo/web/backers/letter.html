	<p>Dear user,</p>
	<p>
	This project takes years of efforts to develop, as a side project, it has to find a way to fund itself and cover its hosting cost which is estimated to be at least $700 a year (including website hosting and domain name cost).
	</p>
	<p>
	As the creator and main contributor of this project, I decide to blur a few of the search results for each page, as a way to monetize this website. Users who have ever became backer or sponsor of this project will be shown all the search results to recognize their support.
	</p>
	<p>
	As a result, I need the StackExchange account information from users to keep a record of our past sponsors/backers. Only your StackExchange account ID will be saved on this website, your search data will never be associated or shared publicly.
	</p>
	<p>
	Thanks for your support and understanding,
	</p>
