{"content": "The cow in the field problem (intersecting circular areas)\n\nWhat length of rope should be used to tie a cow to an exterior fence post of a circular field so that the cow can only graze half of the grass within that field? updated: To be clear: the cow should be tied to a post on the exterior of the field, not a post at the center of the field.  \n\n__ANSWER__\n\nLet the total area of the field = [imath]A[/imath]. We know [imath]A = \\pi R^2[/imath] where [imath]R[/imath] = the radius of the field. We want the cow to be able to graze half the area, so we solve for a length of rope [imath]r[/imath] such that [imath]\\pi r^2 = A / 2[/imath]. This gives: [imath]\\pi r^2 = \\pi R^2 / 2[/imath], hence [imath]r = R / \\sqrt(2)[/imath]. In words, the length of the cow's rope should be the radius of the field divided by sqrt(2).
