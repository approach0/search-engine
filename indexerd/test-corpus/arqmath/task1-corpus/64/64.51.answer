Let the total area of the field = [imath]A[/imath]. We know [imath]A = \pi R^2[/imath] where [imath]R[/imath] = the radius of the field. We want the cow to be able to graze half the area, so we solve for a length of rope [imath]r[/imath] such that [imath]\pi r^2 = A / 2[/imath]. This gives: [imath]\pi r^2 = \pi R^2 / 2[/imath], hence [imath]r = R / \sqrt(2)[/imath]. In words, the length of the cow's rope should be the radius of the field divided by sqrt(2).
