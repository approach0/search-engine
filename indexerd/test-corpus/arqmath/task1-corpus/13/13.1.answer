The basic concept is thus:  A 'countable' infinity is one where you can give each item in the set an integer and 'count' them (even though there are an infinite number of them) An 'uncountable' infinity defies this. You cannot assign an integer to each item in the set because you will miss items.  The key to seeing this is using the 'diagonal slash' argument as originally put forward by Cantor. With a countable infinity, you can create a list of all the items in the set and assign each one a different natural number. This can be done with the naturals (obviously) and the complete range of integers (including negative numbers) and even the rational numbers (so including fractions). It cannot be done with the reals due to the diagonal slash argument:  Create your list of all real numbers and assign each one an integer Create a real number with the rule that the first digit after the decimal point is different from the first digit of your first number, the second digit is different from the second digit of your second number, and so on for all digits Try and place this number in your list of all numbers... it can't be the first number, or the second or the third... and so on down the list.  Reductio Ad Absurdium, your number does not exist in your countable list of all real numbers and must be added on to create a new list. The same process can then be done again to show the list still isn't complete.  This shows a difference between two obviously infinite sets and leads to the somewhat scary conclusion that there are (at least) 2 different forms of infinity.
