The cow in the field problem (intersecting circular areas)

What length of rope should be used to tie a cow to an exterior fence post of a circular field so that the cow can only graze half of the grass within that field? updated: To be clear: the cow should be tied to a post on the exterior of the field, not a post at the center of the field.
