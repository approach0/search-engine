How are we able to calculate specific numbers in the Fibonacci Sequence?

I was reading up on the Fibonacci Sequence,  [imath]\text {{1,1,2,3,5,8,13,....}}[/imath] when I've noticed some were able to calculate specific numbers. So far I've only figured out creating an array and counting to the value, which is incredibly simple, but I reckon I can't find any formula for calculating a Fibonacci number based on it's position. Is there a way to do this? If so, how are we able to apply these formulas to arrays?
