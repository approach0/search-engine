Indeed this is true. The underlying reason is that decimal numbers are not unique representations of the reals. (Technically, there does not exist a bijection between the set of all decimal numbers and the reals.) Here's a very simple proof: [imath]\begin{align} \frac13&=0.333\ldots&\hbox{(by long division)}\\ \implies0.333\ldots\times3&=0.999\ldots&\hbox{(multiplying each digit by $3$)} \end{align}[/imath] Then we already know [imath]0.333\ldots\times3=1[/imath] therefore [imath]0.999\ldots=1[/imath].
