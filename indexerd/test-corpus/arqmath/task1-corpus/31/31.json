{"content": "Is it true that [imath]0.999999999\\dots=1[/imath]?\n\nI'm told by smart people that [imath]0.999999999\\dots=1[/imath] and I believe them, but is there a proof that explains why this is? \n\n__ANSWER__\n\nIndeed this is true. The underlying reason is that decimal numbers are not unique representations of the reals. (Technically, there does not exist a bijection between the set of all decimal numbers and the reals.) Here's a very simple proof: [imath]\\begin{align} \\frac13&=0.333\\ldots&\\hbox{(by long division)}\\\\ \\implies0.333\\ldots\\times3&=0.999\\ldots&\\hbox{(multiplying each digit by $3$)} \\end{align}[/imath] Then we already know [imath]0.333\\ldots\\times3=1[/imath] therefore [imath]0.999\\ldots=1[/imath].
