What is a real number (also rational, decimal, integer, natural, cardinal, ordinal...)?

In mathematics, there seem to be a lot of different types of numbers. What exactly are:  Real numbers Integers Rational numbers Decimals Complex numbers Natural numbers Cardinals Ordinals  And as workmad3 points out, some more advanced types of numbers (I'd never heard of)  Hyper-reals Quaternions Imaginary numbers  Are there any other types of classifications of a number I missed?
