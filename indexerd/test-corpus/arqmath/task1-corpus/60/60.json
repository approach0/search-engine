{"content": "Is it true that [imath]0.999999999\\dots=1[/imath]?\n\nI'm told by smart people that [imath]0.999999999\\dots=1[/imath] and I believe them, but is there a proof that explains why this is? \n\n__ANSWER__\n\nSuppose this was not the case, i.e. [imath]0.9999... \\neq 1[/imath]. Then [imath]0.9999... < 1[/imath] (I hope we agree on that). But between two distinct real numbers, there's always another one (say [imath]x[/imath]) in between, hence [imath]0.9999... < x < 1[/imath]. The decimal representation of [imath]x[/imath] must have a digit somewhere that is not [imath]9[/imath] (otherwise [imath]x = 0.9999...[/imath]). But that means it's actually smaller, [imath]x < 0.9999...[/imath], contradicting the definition of [imath]x[/imath]. Thus, the assumption that there's a number between [imath]0.9999...[/imath] and [imath]1[/imath] is false, hence they're equal.
