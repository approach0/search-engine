{"content": "The cow in the field problem (intersecting circular areas)\n\nWhat length of rope should be used to tie a cow to an exterior fence post of a circular field so that the cow can only graze half of the grass within that field? updated: To be clear: the cow should be tied to a post on the exterior of the field, not a post at the center of the field.  \n\n__ANSWER__\n\nSo, the area of the field is [imath]\\pi r^2[/imath] and you want the cow to be able to graze an area equal to half of that. All you need to do is set up the equation ([imath]r_1[/imath] is the radius of the field, [imath]r_2[/imath] is the length of the rope desired): [imath]\\frac{(\\pi r_1^2)}{2} = \\pi r_2^2[/imath] You can then simplify it down: [imath]\\frac{r_1^2 }{2} =r_2^2[/imath] and then taking roots: [imath]r_2 =\\frac{ r_1 }{\\sqrt{2}}[/imath] So you need a rope that is equal to the radius divided by the square root of [imath]2[/imath], and the post can be no closer than this distance to the edge of the field.
