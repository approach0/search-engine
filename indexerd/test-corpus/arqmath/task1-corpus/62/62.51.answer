So, the area of the field is [imath]\pi r^2[/imath] and you want the cow to be able to graze an area equal to half of that. All you need to do is set up the equation ([imath]r_1[/imath] is the radius of the field, [imath]r_2[/imath] is the length of the rope desired): [imath]\frac{(\pi r_1^2)}{2} = \pi r_2^2[/imath] You can then simplify it down: [imath]\frac{r_1^2 }{2} =r_2^2[/imath] and then taking roots: [imath]r_2 =\frac{ r_1 }{\sqrt{2}}[/imath] So you need a rope that is equal to the radius divided by the square root of [imath]2[/imath], and the post can be no closer than this distance to the edge of the field.
