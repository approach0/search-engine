{"content": "How can you prove that the square root of two is irrational?\n\nI have read a few proofs that [imath]\\sqrt{2}[/imath] is irrational. I have never, however, been able to really grasp what they were talking about. Is there a simplified proof that [imath]\\sqrt{2}[/imath] is irrational? \n\n__ANSWER__\n\nYou use a proof by contradiction. Basically, you suppose that [imath]\\sqrt{2}[/imath] can be written as [imath]p/q[/imath]. Then you know that [imath]2q^2 = p^2[/imath]. However, both [imath]q^2[/imath] and [imath]p^2[/imath] have an even number of factors of two, so [imath]2q^2[/imath] has an odd number of factors of 2, which means it can't be equal to [imath]p^2[/imath].
