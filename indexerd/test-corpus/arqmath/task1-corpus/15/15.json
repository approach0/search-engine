{"content": "What is your favorite online graphing tool?\n\nI'm looking for a nice, quick online graphing tool. The ability to link to, or embed the output would be handy, too. \n\n__ANSWER__\n\nWell, I am not sure where you want to embed the graphs, but Wolfram Alpha is pretty handy for graphing. It has most of the features of Mathematica, can handle 3D functions, and fancy scaling and such. I highly recommend it.
