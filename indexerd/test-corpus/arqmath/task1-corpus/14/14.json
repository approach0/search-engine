{"content": "What Does it Really Mean to Have Different Kinds of Infinities?\n\nCan someone explain to me how there can be different kinds of infinities? I was reading \"The man who loved only numbers\" by Paul Hoffman and came across the concept of countable and uncountable infinities, but they're only words to me. Any help would be appreciated. \n\n__ANSWER__\n\nJust simple intuitive explanation. How many Natural (Integers) Numbers could you count? There are infinitely many, yet you can count them. It's called Countable Set. How many Real Numbers are there? Infinitely as well (Since at least every Natural Number is a Real Number). Yet you won't be able to count them (Intuitively, Let's say you name a number the first, then find the second, I can, for sure, find a number in between, their average which is Real Number as well).  It's called Uncountable Set. What you are after is how we define how big is a given set. Then you should look for Cardinality.
