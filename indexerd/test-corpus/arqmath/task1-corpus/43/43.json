{"content": "Is it true that [imath]0.999999999\\dots=1[/imath]?\n\nI'm told by smart people that [imath]0.999999999\\dots=1[/imath] and I believe them, but is there a proof that explains why this is? \n\n__ANSWER__\n\nYou can visualise it by thinking about it in infinitesimals. The more [imath]9's[/imath] you have on the end of [imath]0.999[/imath], the closer you get to [imath]1[/imath]. When you add an infinite number of [imath]9's[/imath] to the decimal expansion, you are infinitely close to [imath]1[/imath] (or an infinitesimal distance away). And this isn't a rigorous proof, just an aid to visualisation of the result.
