The obvious but slightly trite answer is "because that's just how the cross-product works as an operation". If you're looking for an intuitive reason, the cross-product by definition produces a vector that is orthogonal to the two operand (input) vectors. You know that the base vectors [imath]\mathbf{i}[/imath], [imath]\mathbf{j}[/imath], and [imath]\mathbf{k}[/imath] are all orthogonal, thus if your two input vectors lie on the [imath](x, y)[/imath] plane (i.e. only [imath]\mathbf{i}[/imath] and [imath]\mathbf{j}[/imath] components), you know that any orthogonal vector must have only a component in the [imath]z[/imath] direction (multiple of [imath]\mathbf{k}[/imath]).
