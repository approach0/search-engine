{"content": "Is it true that [imath]0.999999999\\dots=1[/imath]?\n\nI'm told by smart people that [imath]0.999999999\\dots=1[/imath] and I believe them, but is there a proof that explains why this is? \n\n__ANSWER__\n\nWhat I really don't like about all the above answers, is the underlying assumption that [imath]1/3=0.3333\\ldots[/imath] How do you know that? It seems to me like assuming the something which is already known. A proof I really like is: [imath]\\begin{align}     0.9999\\ldots \u00d7 10 &= 9.9999\\ldots\\\\     0.9999\\ldots \u00d7 (9+1) &= 9.9999\\ldots\\\\ \\text{by distribution rule: }\\Space{15ex}{0ex}{0ex} \\\\     0.9999\\ldots \u00d7 9 + 0.9999\\ldots \u00d7 1 &= 9.9999\\ldots\\\\     0.9999\\ldots \u00d7 9 &= 9.9999\\dots-0.9999\\ldots\\\\     0.9999\\ldots \u00d7 9 &= 9\\\\     0.9999\\ldots &= 1 \\end{align}[/imath] The only things I need to assume is, that [imath]9.999\\ldots - 0.999\\ldots = 9[/imath] and that [imath]0.999\\ldots \u00d7 10 = 9.999\\ldots[/imath] These seems to me intuitive enough to take for granted. The proof is from an old high school level math book of the Open University in Israel.
