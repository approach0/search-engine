What I really don't like about all the above answers, is the underlying assumption that [imath]1/3=0.3333\ldots[/imath] How do you know that? It seems to me like assuming the something which is already known. A proof I really like is: [imath]\begin{align}     0.9999\ldots × 10 &= 9.9999\ldots\\     0.9999\ldots × (9+1) &= 9.9999\ldots\\ \text{by distribution rule: }\Space{15ex}{0ex}{0ex} \\     0.9999\ldots × 9 + 0.9999\ldots × 1 &= 9.9999\ldots\\     0.9999\ldots × 9 &= 9.9999\dots-0.9999\ldots\\     0.9999\ldots × 9 &= 9\\     0.9999\ldots &= 1 \end{align}[/imath] The only things I need to assume is, that [imath]9.999\ldots - 0.999\ldots = 9[/imath] and that [imath]0.999\ldots × 10 = 9.999\ldots[/imath] These seems to me intuitive enough to take for granted. The proof is from an old high school level math book of the Open University in Israel.
