{"content": "What is a real number (also rational, decimal, integer, natural, cardinal, ordinal...)?\n\nIn mathematics, there seem to be a lot of different types of numbers. What exactly are:  Real numbers Integers Rational numbers Decimals Complex numbers Natural numbers Cardinals Ordinals  And as workmad3 points out, some more advanced types of numbers (I'd never heard of)  Hyper-reals Quaternions Imaginary numbers  Are there any other types of classifications of a number I missed? \n\n__ANSWER__\n\n Natural numbers The \"counting\" numbers.  (That is, all integers, that are one or greater). Whole numbers The Natural numbers, and zero. Integers The Whole numbers, and the negatives of the Natural numbers. Rational numbers Any number that may be expressed by any integer A divided by any integer B, where B is not zero. Irrational numbers Any number that cannot be expressed as a rational number, but is not imaginary.  All irrational numbers have an infinite decimal representation. Real numbers All of the Rational and Irrational numbers. Imaginary numbers All Real numbers, multiplied by the square root of negative one.  Imaginary numbers are signified by the letter i. Complex numbers Numbers composed of the sum of a Real and an Imaginary number.  This includes all Real and all Imaginary numbers.
