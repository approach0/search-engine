Consider this proof by contradiction: Assume that [imath]\sqrt{2}[/imath] is rational. Then there exists some rational [imath]R=\sqrt{2}=\frac{Q}{D}[/imath], where [imath]Q[/imath] and [imath]D[/imath] are positive integers and relatively prime (since [imath]R[/imath] can be expressed in simplified form). Now consider [imath]R^2 = 2 = \frac{Q^2}{D^2}[/imath]. Since [imath]Q[/imath] and [imath]D[/imath] are relatively prime, this means that only [imath]Q^2[/imath] can have [imath]2[/imath] in its prime decomposition, and the exponent must be one. Thus, [imath]Q^2 = 2^1 x[/imath], for some odd integer [imath]x[/imath]. But [imath]Q^2[/imath] is a square, and thus the exponents for all of its prime factors must be even. Here we have a contradiction. Thus, [imath]\sqrt{2}[/imath] must be irrational.
