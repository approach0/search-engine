There are several important kinds of relations, each of which satisfy a different collection of properties: Equivalence relations: These are reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.  Essentially they're relations that "behave like equality."  The most important elementary one is "equivalence modulo m," where say 1 = 6 = 11 modulo 5. Partial orderings: These are reflexive, transitive, and (anti-symmetric or maybe asymmetric, I'm having trouble parsing your logical statements).  Essentially they're relations that "behave like less than or equal to."  An important elementary example is "divides" where we say a|b if the ratio b/a is an integer.  Note that 2|6 but 6 does not divide 2.  However if 2|4 and 4|8 certainly 2|8.
