Assuming you know the definition of orthogonal as "a is orthogonal to b iff [imath]a\cdot b=0[/imath] then we could calculate [imath](a \times b)\cdot a = a_1(a_2b_3-a_3b_2)-a_2(a_1b_3-a_3b_1)-a_3(a_1b_2-a_2b_1)=0[/imath] and  [imath](a \times b)\cdot b-0[/imath], so the cross product is orthogonal to both. As Nold mentioned, if the two vectors a and b lie in the x,y plane, then the orthogonal vectors must be purely in the z direction.
