What does it mean when you refer to [imath].99999\ldots[/imath]?  Symbols don't mean anything in particular until you've defined what you mean by them. In this case the definition is that you are taking the limit of [imath].9[/imath], [imath].99[/imath], [imath].999[/imath], [imath].9999[/imath], etc.  What does it mean to say that limit is [imath]1[/imath]?  Well, it means that no matter how small a number [imath]x[/imath] you pick, I can show you a point in that sequence such that all further numbers in the sequence are within distance [imath]x[/imath] of [imath]1[/imath].  But certainly whatever number you choose your number is bigger than [imath]10^{-k}[/imath] for some [imath]k[/imath].  So I can just pick my point to be the [imath]k[/imath]th spot in the sequence. A more intuitive way of explaining the above argument is that the reason [imath].99999\ldots = 1[/imath] is that their difference is zero.  So let's subtract [imath]1.0000\ldots -.99999\ldots = .00000\ldots = 0[/imath].  That is,  [imath]1.0 -.9 = .1[/imath] [imath]1.00-.99 = .01[/imath] [imath]1.000-.999=.001[/imath],  [imath]\ldots[/imath] [imath]1.000\ldots -.99999\ldots = .000\ldots = 0[/imath]
