{"content": "Can you recommend a decent online or software calculator?\n\nI'm looking for an online or software calculator that can show me the history of items I typed in, much like an expensive Ti calculator.  Can you recommend any? \n\n__ANSWER__\n\nEssentially the most helpful is WolframAlpha, as Ami said, you can use your browser history here too. WolframAlpha can carry out complex equations can comparisons much like a TI Calculator. Additionally they have some areas where you can see the simplification of an equation paired with charts and graphs where possible.
