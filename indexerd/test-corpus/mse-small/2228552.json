{"text": "Math/Physics Circuit Problem from CAP contest involving Resistance\n\nConsider a circuit made of a wire with uniform resistance\nin a shape of a circle as shown in the picture. The\ncircle is connected diagonally from point A to point B\nwith the same type of wire. If the current passing\nthrough the circuit is i0, what is the current passing\nthrough the wire AB as a function of angle \u03b8?\n\n\nDid you try applying Kirchoff laws? Should be pretty straight forward.\nWhy will it even depend on [imath]\\theta[/imath]?\n@UddeshyaSingh Consider [imath]\\theta=\\frac{\\pi}{2}[/imath]. The wire is as good as nonexistent (there is no current through it). Now consider [imath]\\theta=0[/imath].\nYou can adapt the solution to the problem from here. Tell us whether or not you succeed.\nIf an answer addresses your question in a satisfactory manner, it is customary to accept the answer.\n\nExcuse the clumsy 'artwork':\nWithout loss of generality we can take the resistance per unit length to be one and we can take the radius to be one.\nOne approach is to use  Norton's theorem. (a) shows the general\ncircuit and (b) shows how the current splits between two resistors.\n(c) Shows how the Norton equivalent resistance is computed and (d)\nshows how the Norton short circuit current is computed (with the aid of\n(b)).\n(e) Shows the Norton equivalent circuit and from this (again with the aid of\n(b)) shows that\n[imath]i_D = {1 \\over 1 + {4 \\over \\pi}}(1-{2 \\theta \\over \\pi}) i_0[/imath].\n\nAnother approach would be to perform a [imath]\\Delta-Y[/imath] conversion on the three rightmost resistors in (a).\n\n\n", "url": "http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2228552/math-physics-circuit-problem-from-cap-contest-involving-resistance"}
