{"text": "About [imath]\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{5},\\sqrt[3]{7})[/imath]\n\nLet [imath]K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{5},\\sqrt[3]{7})\\subset \\mathbb{C}[/imath]. To compute [imath][K:\\mathbb{Q}][/imath], I know that \n\\begin{align*}\n[\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{5}):\\mathbb{Q}]&=2\\\\\n[\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt[3]{7}):\\mathbb{Q}]&=3.\n\\end{align*}\nCan I say that [imath]2<[K:\\mathbb{Q}]\\leq 6[/imath] and because [imath]2\\not |[/imath] [imath]3,5[/imath] and [imath]3\\not | [/imath] [imath]4[/imath], then [imath][K:\\mathbb{Q}]=6[/imath]?\nAnd, if [imath]\\gamma=\\sqrt{5}\\sqrt[3]{7}[/imath], the minimal polynomial of [imath]\\gamma[/imath] over [imath]\\mathbb{Q}(\\gamma)[/imath] would be [imath]p(x)=x^6-5^37^2?[/imath]\nI'm a bit insecure about this.\nThanks in advance.\n\n\nIf [imath]K=\\Bbb Q(\\sqrt5,\\sqrt[3]7)[/imath] then [imath]|K:\\Bbb Q|=|K:\\Bbb Q(\\sqrt5)|\n|\\Bbb Q(\\sqrt5):\\Bbb Q|[/imath] so [imath]|K:\\Bbb Q|[/imath] is divisible by [imath]2[/imath].\nSimilarly [imath]|K:\\Bbb Q|[/imath] is divisible by [imath]3[/imath] (why?). So\nit is divisible by [imath]6[/imath] (as [imath]2[/imath] and [imath]3[/imath] are coprime). But [imath]|K:\\Bbb Q|\\le 6[/imath]\n(why?).\n\nIf [imath]|K:Q|>6[/imath], then the minimal polynomial can't have degree 6?\n@Nico that's one way to see it.\n\n", "url": "http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2242052/about-mathbbq-sqrt5-sqrt37"}
