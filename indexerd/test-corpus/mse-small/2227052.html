Show [imath]\mathcal F[/imath] is a normal family in [imath]C(G,\Bbb C)[/imath]</br></br>Consider [imath]G=\{z\in\Bbb C: \Re(z)>0\}[/imath] and let [imath]\mathcal F=\{f_{\lambda}:G\to\Bbb C:\lambda>0\}[/imath] where [imath]f_{\lambda}=e^{-\lambda z}[/imath] for each [imath]z\in G[/imath]. Show that [imath]\mathcal F[/imath] is a normal family in [imath]C(G,\Bbb C)[/imath].</br>My attempt is that normal family is that every sequence in the family has a convergent subsequence. By Montel's theorem, a family in [imath]H(G)[/imath] in normal iff [imath]\mathcal F[/imath] is locally bounded.</br>To show [imath]\mathcal F[/imath] is locally bounded, since [imath]|e^{-\lambda z}|=e^{-\lambda \Re(z)}\le 1[/imath] for any [imath]f\in \mathcal F[/imath], [imath]z\in G[/imath],  thus it is locally bounded, so by Montel's theorem, [imath]\mathcal F[/imath] is a normal family.</br>I am not sure if the above is correct. Could anyone kindly help look at it? Thanks so much! </br></br>This is correct because the space of holomorphic functions is (usually considered as) a topological subspace of the space of continuous functions (i.e., both are endowed with the topology of uniform convergence on compact subsets of [imath]G[/imath]).</br></br>
