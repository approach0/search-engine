<h2>This is a math-content preview for <a href="http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2230552/determinant-and-determinant-functionexplanation">http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2230552/determinant-and-determinant-functionexplanation</a></h2>
Determinant and determinant function(explanation)</br></br>1) A determinant function on [imath]n[/imath]-dim vector space [imath]V[/imath] is map [imath]\Delta: V*V*V*\dots*V \to K[/imath] with two properties:</br>determinant function is [imath]n[/imath]-multilinear;</br>if determinant function has in input two equal vectors, than determinant function is 0.</br>2) Suppose [imath]V[/imath] is [imath]n[/imath]-dim [imath]K[/imath]-vector space and [imath]f \in \mathrm{End}_k(V)[/imath]. Choose [imath]0 \neq A \in \Lambda^n V^*[/imath] and define [imath]\Delta f[/imath] as </br>[imath]</br>\Delta f = \Delta(f(a_1),\dots,f(a_n)) \implies \exists \,\det(f) \in K: \Delta f = (\det(f))\Delta.</br>[/imath]</br>The scalar [imath]\det(f)[/imath] is determinant of [imath]f[/imath].</br>Maybe it's a weird question, but I cannot connect and intuitive understand definitions of determinant function and determinant. As I understood, determinant function takes set of vectors(matrix) and returns scalar.</br>But what does the formula [imath](\det(f))\Delta[/imath] mean? what is [imath]\Delta f[/imath] and why does the relationship [imath]\Delta f = (\det(f))\Delta[/imath] hold?</br>Can you provide also the intuition?</br></br>Looking at this question, it looks like most of your confusion will be cleared up when you reach the end of the chapter. [imath]\Delta f[/imath] is defined here. There's a lot I don't understand here (what does the lambda mean, and what function does [imath]A[/imath] have, etc) But there exists only one determinant function. It seems like you're making preparations to prove that, so maybe that will give some context?</br>You must have made a mistake in transcribing 2), as it makes no sense. First, you have not explained what the [imath]a_i[/imath] and their relation to [imath]A[/imath] are. I assume [imath]a_i \in V[/imath], to make sense of [imath]\Delta((f(a_1),\ldots,f(a_n))[/imath], which is a scalar; but then there is no way for this scalar to be equal to [imath]\det(f) \Delta[/imath], which is a multilinear map. It would be best if you included a link to the original reference.</br></br>
