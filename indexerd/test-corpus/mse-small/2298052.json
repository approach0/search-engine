{"text": "On [imath]0[/imath]'s in repeating decimals.\n\nGiven [imath]a\\in\\Bbb N[/imath] then [imath]\\frac1a[/imath] is of form [imath]0.0\\dots0r_1\\dots r_k0\\dots0r_1\\dots r_k\\dots[/imath].\nWhat determines the length of [imath]0[/imath] runs?\n\nSuppose the run of [imath]0[/imath]s has length [imath]n\\,[/imath], then [imath]a = \\overline{r_1r_2\\dots r_k} / (10^{n+k} - 1)\\,[/imath]. Not clear on how you want to translate that into What determines n.\n\nIf your number starts with precisely [imath]m[/imath] zeroes, it is between [imath]0.\\underbrace{0\\ldots0}_m1=10^{-m-1}[/imath] (inclusive) and [imath]0.\\underbrace{0\\ldots0}_{m-1}1=10^{-m}[/imath] (exclusive). In other words, [imath]10^{m}<a\\le10^{m+1}[/imath].\n\nI think this completely shortcuts what I was in the process of composing.\n\nOne way to think about it would be the following: \nThe zero runs tell you when you approximate this real number using positive decimal steps, how small each subsequent approximation step gets.\n\n\n", "url": "http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2298052/on-0s-in-repeating-decimals"}
