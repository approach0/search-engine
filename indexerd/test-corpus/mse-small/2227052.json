{"text": "Show [imath]\\mathcal F[/imath] is a normal family in [imath]C(G,\\Bbb C)[/imath]\n\nConsider [imath]G=\\{z\\in\\Bbb C: \\Re(z)>0\\}[/imath] and let [imath]\\mathcal F=\\{f_{\\lambda}:G\\to\\Bbb C:\\lambda>0\\}[/imath] where [imath]f_{\\lambda}=e^{-\\lambda z}[/imath] for each [imath]z\\in G[/imath]. Show that [imath]\\mathcal F[/imath] is a normal family in [imath]C(G,\\Bbb C)[/imath].\nMy attempt is that normal family is that every sequence in the family has a convergent subsequence. By Montel's theorem, a family in [imath]H(G)[/imath] in normal iff [imath]\\mathcal F[/imath] is locally bounded.\nTo show [imath]\\mathcal F[/imath] is locally bounded, since [imath]|e^{-\\lambda z}|=e^{-\\lambda \\Re(z)}\\le 1[/imath] for any [imath]f\\in \\mathcal F[/imath], [imath]z\\in G[/imath],  thus it is locally bounded, so by Montel's theorem, [imath]\\mathcal F[/imath] is a normal family.\nI am not sure if the above is correct. Could anyone kindly help look at it? Thanks so much! \n\nThis is correct because the space of holomorphic functions is (usually considered as) a topological subspace of the space of continuous functions (i.e., both are endowed with the topology of uniform convergence on compact subsets of [imath]G[/imath]).\n\n", "url": "http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2227052/show-mathcal-f-is-a-normal-family-in-cg-bbb-c"}
