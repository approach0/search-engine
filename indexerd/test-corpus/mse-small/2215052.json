{"text": "How to solve [imath]\\lim_{(x,y)\\to(-1,1)}\\frac{4x-y+5}{(1+2x+y)^2}[/imath]?\n\nI have a limit:\n[imath]\\lim_{(x,y)\\to(-1,1)}\\frac{4x-y+5}{(1+2x+y)^2}[/imath]\nIs my solution correct? If not, what is step by step solution for this limit? Thank you.\nMy solution:\nI replaced [imath]y[/imath] with [imath]k(x^2+1)+1[/imath].\n[imath]\\lim_{x\\to-1\\\\y=k(x^2+1)+1}\\frac{4x-(k(x^2+1)+1)+5}{(1+2x+(k(x^2+1)+1))^2}=\\lim_{x\\to-1}\\frac{4x-kx^2-k+4}{(2x+kx^2+k+2)^2}=\\frac{-4-k-k+4}{(-2+k+k+2)^2}=\\frac{-2k}{4k^2}[/imath]\nLimit depends on [imath]k[/imath] so limit does not exist.\n\nIf we plug in [imath]x=-1[/imath] in [imath]k(x^2+1)+1[/imath], we get [imath]2k+1[/imath] ... Try [imath]y=k(x+1)+1[/imath]\nThen I've got 0/0. Is that means I should use different aproach?\nWhen you choose the path [imath]\\;y=k(x^2+1)+1\\;[/imath], you get that if [imath]\\;x\\to-1\\;[/imath] then [imath]\\;y\\to2k+1\\;[/imath] , which isn't [imath]\\;1\\;[/imath] unless [imath]\\;k=0\\;[/imath] ...\n\nTo calculate variables with substitution it must be that on that particular pat you approach the wanted point... For example, take [imath]\\;y=k(x+1)+1\\;[/imath] (observe that [imath]\\;x\\to-1\\;\\implies\\;y\\to1\\;[/imath], as required), so the limit is\n[imath]\\lim_{x\\to-1}\\frac{4x-kx-k-1+5}{(1+2x+kx+k+1)^2}=\\lim_{x\\to-1}\\frac{(4-k)(x+1)}{(2+k)^2(x+1)^2}=\\lim_{x\\to-1}\\frac{4-k}{(2+k)^2(x+1)}[/imath]\nand the last limit doesn't even exist finitely, so the original one neither does.\n\nIsn't [imath](2x+kx+k+2)^2[/imath] equals to [imath](2+k)^2(x+1)^2[/imath] instead of [imath](2+k)(x+1)[/imath]?\n@user428015 Indeed so, and I'm going to correct that now, thanks...yet thart makes it even clearer the limit cannot exist! :)\n\n", "url": "http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2215052/how-to-solve-lim-x-y-to-1-1-frac4x-y512xy2"}
