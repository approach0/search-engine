{"text": "Differential equation, periodic solution, eigenvalues\n\nSorry for my bad english.\nLet [imath]u : \\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^n[/imath] a solution of a linear differential equation [imath] x'(t) = Ax(t)[/imath] [imath](1)[/imath] with [imath] A \\in M_{nn}(\\mathbb{R})[/imath]. We suppose A is a diagonalizable matrix.\nWe want to prove that if this equation has a periodic solution (non-zero) with period [imath]T > 0[/imath], then the matrix [imath]e^{TA}[/imath] has the eigenvalue [imath]1[/imath] ; and to deduce that if all the eigenvalues of A are real, then [imath](1)[/imath] hasn't periodic solution non constant.\nI don't see how to make explicit it. Someone could help me ? Thank you in advance...\n\nHint: in the Eigenvector basis, the equations simplify to [imath]x'_i(t)=\\lambda_i x_i(t)[/imath] for which the solutions are obvious.\n\nIf [imath]A[/imath] is diagonalizable then, there is a frame of reference in which the solved system is decoupled:\n[imath]y_i'(t) = \\lambda_i\\, y_i(t)[/imath]\nBeing [imath]A=P\\Lambda P^{-1}[/imath] and [imath]\\Lambda = diag{(\\lambda_i)}[/imath]\nThis system of equations leads to the following solution:\n[imath]y(t) = \\exp{(\\Lambda t)} c[/imath]\nFor any constant vector [imath]c[/imath]\nIf the eigenvalues of [imath]A[/imath] (the same as the eigenvalues of the diagonalized matrix [imath]\\Lambda[/imath]) [imath]\\textit{i.e.}[/imath] the numbers [imath]\\lambda_i[/imath] are all complex the solutions are periodic, with period [imath]T[/imath]:\n[imath]y(t) = \\exp{(\\Lambda t)} c= \\exp{(i\\,\\mathcal{Im}\\left\\{\\Lambda\\right\\} t)} c[/imath]\n (note that [imath]\\exp{it}=\\cos{t}+i\\sin{t}[/imath])\nOn the contrary they are not periodic, leading to exponentials that increase or decrease with time\n[imath]y(t) = \\exp{(\\Lambda t)} c[/imath]\nRecovering the original variable [imath]x(t)[/imath] one has\n[imath]x(t) = P\\exp{(\\Lambda t)} c[/imath]\n\n\n", "url": "http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2261052/differential-equation-periodic-solution-eigenvalues"}
