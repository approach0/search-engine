{"text": "When homogeneous coordinate ring of an Abelian variety is Gorenstein?\n\nLet [imath]A[/imath] be an abelian variety of dimension at least [imath]2[/imath]. If [imath]A[/imath] is embedded into a projective space by a very ample line bundle [imath]\\mathcal{L}[/imath] under which assumptions on [imath]\\mathcal{L}[/imath] the homogeneous coordinate ring \n[imath]\nR = \\oplus_{i \\geq 0} H^0(A, \\mathcal{L}^i)\n[/imath]\nof [imath]A[/imath] is a graded Gorenstein ring?\n\nThis ring is never Cohen-Macaulay and hence can not be Gorenstein.\nHow one can prove this? Any references?\nIf it were CM, it is very easy to check that [imath]H^i(L^k)=0[/imath] for all [imath]k[/imath] and [imath]0<i<\\dim A[/imath]. In your case, since [imath]\\dim A>1[/imath] and [imath]H^1(\\mathcal{O}_A)\\neq 0[/imath], you are done.\n\nThe definition of Gorenstein ring is a local one, a ring [imath]R[/imath] is Gorenstein if for every prime ideal [imath]R_p[/imath] is a local Gorenstein ring.\nFor an abelian variety, you will have a Gorenstein ring which is not arithmetically Gorenstein, i.e. if you look at the global equations they do not determine a Conhen-Macaulay ideal. On the other hand, for every localisation it is Gorenstein (and hence CM).\nCheck the following thesis for the construction of the coordinate ring of an abelian surface with a polarisation of type (1,3).\nhttp://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/80934/\n\n\n", "url": "http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2205552/when-homogeneous-coordinate-ring-of-an-abelian-variety-is-gorenstein"}
