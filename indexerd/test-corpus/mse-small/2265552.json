{"text": "Tensors with conventional names?\n\nI was wondering, what kinds of tensors (in the sense of \"multi-index arrays of numbers\") exist that have conventional names, which can help describing results of tensor calculations.\nI can only think of two examples:\nThe 2nd-rank Kronecker delta defined as \n[imath] \\delta_{a,b} = \\begin{cases}\n1 & \\mathrm{if}~a=b \\\\\n0 & \\mathrm{otherwise}\n\\end{cases} [/imath]\nThe arbitrary-rank Levi-Civita symbol defined as [imath]\n  \\epsilon_{a_1,...,a_r} = \\begin{cases}\n+1&\\text{if }(a_1,...,a_r)\\text{ an even permutation of }(1,...,r)\\\\\n-1&\\text{if }(a_1,...,a_r)\\text{ an odd permutation of }(1,...,r)\\\\\n0&\\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n[/imath]\nI am trying to find conventional names to express tensors I encountered in group theory. An example was a [imath]3\\times3\\times3[/imath] tensor [imath]A_{abc}[/imath] with 6 equal elements at the positions where [imath]a,b,c[/imath] are mutually different, which can be expressed as [imath]A_{abc} \\propto |\\epsilon_{abc}|[/imath], and a [imath]3\\times3\\times3\\times3[/imath] tensor which had 9 equal non-zero elements at positions matching an index pattern [imath]aabb[/imath] (6 elements) or [imath]aaaa[/imath] (3 elemets) (assuming [imath]a\\neq b[/imath]), which can be written as [imath]A_{abcd} \\propto \\delta_{ab} \\delta_{cd}[/imath]. \nHowever, I also came across a tensor which had 21 equal non-zero elements for the patterns [imath]aaaa[/imath] (3), [imath]aabb[/imath] (6), (as above) but additionally also for [imath]abab[/imath] (6) and [imath]abba[/imath] (6). I couldn't figure out any convenient way to express this tensor, that didn't require introducing a new \"tensor of ones\". The closest I got was [imath]\\delta_{ab}\\delta_{cd}+\\delta_{ac}\\delta_{bd}+\\delta_{ad}\\delta_{bc} - 2\\delta_{ab}\\delta_{bc}\\delta_{cd}[/imath], but that is hardly concise nor is it obvious from looking at the equation that all non-zero components are the same.\nThis question may be related to asking for tensors which are invariant under orthonormal basis transformations.\n\nI haven't seen the notation [imath]\\delta_{abcd}[/imath] for the quantity that is [imath]1[/imath] for [imath]a = b = c = d[/imath] and zero otherwise, but one can just write [imath]\\delta_{abcd}[/imath] as [imath]\\delta_{ab} \\delta_{ac} \\delta_{ad}.[/imath]\nIIRC the only tensors which are invariant under orthogonal transformations (i.e., elements of [imath]SO(n)[/imath]) in a general linear vector space are [imath]\\delta_{ab}[/imath], [imath]\\epsilon_{abc\\cdots}[/imath], and tensor products thereof.\nIf you're looking for a good exposition of invariant subspaces of tensor spaces under [imath]SO(3)[/imath] transformations, I would suggest looking in Hamermesh's Group Theory and its Applications to Physical Problems.  Unfortunately I lent out my copy and don't have the time to reconstruct all of the results necessary, or I'd summarize it as an answer.\n@Travis Good point, I'll update that part.\nYou could replace the expression in question with [imath]\\delta_{ab} \\delta_{ac} \\delta_{ad} \\delta_{bc} \\delta_{bd} \\delta_{bc}[/imath]. It's ugly and not very parsimonious, but at least it makes it more or less apparently that the resulting expression is symmetric in [imath]a, b, c, d[/imath].\n\n", "url": "http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2265552/tensors-with-conventional-names"}
