[imath]\\small a_n=\\frac{239 n^{11}}{3628800} - \\frac{941 n^{10}}{201600} + \\frac{15121 n^9}{103680} - \\frac{106627 n^8}{40320} + \\frac{4142051 n^7}{134400} - \\frac{6953329 n^6}{28800} + \\frac{937219637 n^5}{725760} - \\frac{189056173 n^4}{40320} + \\frac{1457296303 n^3}{129600} - \\frac{846796739 n^2}{50400} + \\frac{35016917 n}{2520} - 4727[/imath]\n\nSeems to be of the form [imath]1,2,1,3,\\ldots,k,2^k,k,3\\cdot 2^{k-1},\\ldots[/imath].  However, there are infinitely many sequences with \"reasonably good definitions\" which start with a given finite subsequence.  The sequence given by projectilemotion is a perfectly good one.\n\n\n", "url": "http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2260552/find-a-closed-form-solution-for-the-following-sequence-1-2-1-3-2-4-2-6-3-8-3-12"}
