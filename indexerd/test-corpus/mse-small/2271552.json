{"text": "How can I rewrite [imath]\\sin(ax)[/imath] as a function of [imath]\\sin(bx)[/imath], where: [imath]x,a,b[/imath] are real positive numbers?\n\nHow can I rewrite [imath]\\sin(ax)[/imath] as a function of [imath]\\sin(bx)[/imath], where: [imath]x,a,b[/imath] are real positive numbers?\nFor instance, if [imath]y=\\sin(ax)[/imath] then [imath]\\sin(bx)=f(y)[/imath], but [imath]f[/imath] is a function that use only [imath]+,-,\\times,/,{}^\\wedge[/imath]; in other words I need to represent [imath]\\sin(bx)[/imath] by [imath]\\sin(ax)[/imath] algebraically.\n\nCould you give us a concrete example, still not clear what exactly you want.\n\nFor most [imath]a[/imath] and [imath]b[/imath], you cannot. Any such function must satisfy [imath]g\\left(x+\\frac{2\\pi}a\\right)=g(x)[/imath] for all [imath]x[/imath], while [imath]\\sin(bx)[/imath] usually does not.\n\n\n", "url": "http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2271552/how-can-i-rewrite-sinax-as-a-function-of-sinbx-where-x-a-b-are-rea"}
