{"text": "How to determine whether a number can be expressed as a sum of factorials\n\nI'm looking for a way to determine (without calculating) whether a positive integer N can be written as the sum of factorials of random numbers where a number cannot be used more than once. For instance, [imath]7 = 1! + 3! = 0! + 3![/imath] [imath]or,[/imath] [imath]6 = 3![/imath] But we can't write 5 or 11 in such a way. So I'm now looking for a way to know whether a given number can be written in such a way without calculating. If there is, then how?\n\nI don't think there is an easy algorithm for it, but I would (and I probably will) write down the first handful of numbers that cannot be written in such a way and then search on OEIS.\nThank you. I didn't know of OEIS. :) @Lovsovs\nSee OEIS sequence A059590 (except that sequence does not count 0! and 1! as distinct factorials, so it omits 4, 10, 28 etc.). Since factorials grow so quickly a greedy algorithm (en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greedy_algorithm) will always work.\n[imath]5=0!+1!+0!+2![/imath]\n@Simply Beautiful Art: Please read the 1st line carefully. No numbers can't be used more than once. Else we can write any number in such a way: [imath]5 = 0! + 0! + 0! + 0! + 0![/imath] :) Thank you\n\n", "url": "http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2241552/how-to-determine-whether-a-number-can-be-expressed-as-a-sum-of-factorials"}
