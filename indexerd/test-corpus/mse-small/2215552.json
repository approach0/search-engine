{"text": "Proving that sum of injective and Lipschitz continuous function is injective?\n\nSuppose that [imath]H:A\\rightarrow B[/imath] can be written as [imath]H(x) = x + h(x)[/imath], where\n[imath]h[/imath] is Lipschitz on [imath]A[/imath] with constant [imath]0 < \\delta < 1[/imath]. I need to show that H is\ninjective.\nHere is my attempt at proving this please let me know if it is correct. \nProof: Suppose that H is not injective and hence [imath]H(x) = H(y) \\text{ for } x\\neq y[/imath].\nThis can be written as [imath]x+h(x) = y+h(y)[/imath].\nNow consider a constant function such that [imath]h(x) = h(y)[/imath] which is obviously Lipshitz but this implies that [imath]x=y[/imath] which is a contradiction and hence [imath]H[/imath] is injective. \n\nWhy don't you just start as usual: [imath]H(x) = H(y)[/imath]. Then?\n@FriedrichPhilipp I have edited the question with my attempt, can you please take a look and let me know if it is correct?\nYou cannot just choose some [imath]h[/imath]. This function is fixed and you have to work with it. You have correctly [imath]x + h(x) = y + h(y)[/imath]. Now, subtract [imath]y[/imath] and [imath]h(x)[/imath] and take the norm (or absolute value) on both sides.\nok that gives me [imath]|x-y|=|h(x)-h(y)|[/imath] and from [imath]h[/imath] being Lipschitz we know [imath]|h(x)-h(y)|\\leq\\delta|x-y|[/imath] where [imath]0<\\delta<1[/imath], hence it's a contradiction and it implies [imath]H(x)\\neq H(y)[/imath]. Does that make sense?\nYes, that is perfect.\n\nSuppose [imath]H(x)=H(y)[/imath], then [imath]h(x)-h(y) = y-x[/imath]. Since\n[imath]d(h(x),h(y)) \\le \\delta d(y,x)[/imath], we get\n[imath]d(x,y) \\le \\delta d(x,y)[/imath] and the only solution to this is [imath]x=y[/imath].\n\n\nI'd think of it this way: you have two real functions, one, say, [imath]f[/imath], is [imath](1 - \\epsilon)[/imath]-contracting and other [imath]g[/imath] [imath](1 + \\delta)[/imath]-expanding, [imath]\\epsilon > 0, \\delta \\ge 0 [/imath] , and you want to prove injectivity of their sum. If you look at their graphs, then for each point on graph of [imath]f[/imath] will lie in a cone like this [imath]><[/imath] with apex on that point and graph of [imath]g[/imath] will lie inside vertical part of similar one, but with obtuse angle. With a bit of triangle inequality usage you'll see that [imath]C(f + g)[/imath] will be expanding for some [imath]C[/imath], expanding maps are obviously injective and multiplication is a bijection.\n\n\n", "url": "http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2215552/proving-that-sum-of-injective-and-lipschitz-continuous-function-is-injective"}
