Find a closed form solution for the following sequence 1,2,1,3,2,4,2,6,3,8,3,12 [closed]</br></br>I need help with this problem. </br>Find a closed form solution for the following sequence 1,2,1,3,2,4,2,6,3,8,3,12</br>This question appears to be off-topic. The users who voted to close gave this specific reason:"This question is missing context or other details: Please improve the question by providing additional context, which ideally includes your thoughts on the problem and any attempts you have made to solve it. This information helps others identify where you have difficulties and helps them write answers appropriate to your experience level." â€“ Batominovski, Hans Lundmark, user1551, Smylic, Shailesh If this question can be reworded to fit the rules in the help center, please edit the question.</br></br>I can't really identify what the sequence is supposed to be to begin with.</br>This works.  [imath]\small a_n=\frac{239 n^{11}}{3628800} - \frac{941 n^{10}}{201600} + \frac{15121 n^9}{103680} - \frac{106627 n^8}{40320} + \frac{4142051 n^7}{134400} - \frac{6953329 n^6}{28800} + \frac{937219637 n^5}{725760} - \frac{189056173 n^4}{40320} + \frac{1457296303 n^3}{129600} - \frac{846796739 n^2}{50400} + \frac{35016917 n}{2520} - 4727[/imath]</br></br>Seems to be of the form [imath]1,2,1,3,\ldots,k,2^k,k,3\cdot 2^{k-1},\ldots[/imath].  However, there are infinitely many sequences with "reasonably good definitions" which start with a given finite subsequence.  The sequence given by projectilemotion is a perfectly good one.</br></br></br>
