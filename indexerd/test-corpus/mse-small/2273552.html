Prove that the following expression is always less than x for all values of x and k.</br></br>Prove that  </br>[imath]\frac{x^2+kx}{2x+k}[/imath]</br>is less than x for all values of x and k where x>0,  k>0 and k is a constant.</br>How would I prove this? I have differentiated it with respect to x and noticed that the derivative is always less than 1 for all values of x and k, this means that if the value of x increases the value out always increases less than the increase in x.  </br></br>+1, but please try and be careful to get things right when writing questions as editing after having gotten answers had can sometimes be interpreted as disrespectful.</br></br>Multiplying by [imath]2x+k[/imath] positive, [imath]x^2+kx<x(2x+k)[/imath]</br>then</br>[imath]x^2>0.[/imath]</br>Alternatively,</br>[imath]\frac{x^2+kx}{2x+k}-x=-\frac{x^2}{2x+k}<0.[/imath]</br></br>Sorry I wrote down the expression wrong. Edited.</br>I made mistakes myself. Everything fixed now.</br></br>
