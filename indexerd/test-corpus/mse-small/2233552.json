{"text": "Proving with AM-GM Inequality\n\n[imath]\\frac{4}{abcd}\\geq\\frac{a}{b}+\\frac{b}{c}+\\frac{c}{d}+\\frac{d}{a}[/imath]\nGiven: [imath]a+b+c+d=4[/imath] and [imath]a[/imath], [imath]b[/imath], [imath]c[/imath] abd [imath]d[/imath] are positives.\nHow to prove the above inequality using Arithmetic Geometric Mean Inequality?\nI tried the following but, I am getting stuck after last step.\n\n\nAdd it to your question instead of as a comment, that way is easier for everyone. There is an edit button at the bottom of your question.\nAre [imath]a,b,c,d[/imath] all positive?\n@arthur I have added whatever I have tried.\n@vrugtehagel yes, all are positive.\n\nLet [imath]\\{a,b,c,d\\}=\\{x,y,z,t\\}[/imath], where [imath]x\\geq y\\geq z\\geq t[/imath].\nHence, by Rearrengement and AM-GM we obtain:\n[imath]\\frac{a}{b}+\\frac{b}{c}+\\frac{c}{d}+\\frac{d}{a}=\\frac{1}{abcd}(a^2cd+b^2da+c^2ab+d^2bc)=[/imath]\n[imath]=\\frac{1}{abcd}(a\\cdot acd+b\\cdot bda+c\\cdot cab+d\\cdot dbc)\\leq[/imath]\n[imath]\\leq\\frac{1}{abcd}(x\\cdot xyz+y\\cdot xyt+z\\cdot xzt+t\\cdot yzt)=[/imath]\n[imath]=\\frac{1}{abcd}(x^2yz+y^2xt+z^2xt+t^2yz)=\\frac{1}{abcd}(xy+zt)(xz+yt)\\leq[/imath]\n[imath]\\leq\\frac{1}{abcd}\\left(\\frac{xy+zt+xz+yt}{2}\\right)^2=[/imath]\n[imath]=\\frac{1}{4abcd}\\left((x+t)(y+z)\\right)^2\\leq\\frac{1}{4abcd}\\left(\\frac{x+y+z+t}{2}\\right)^4=\\frac{4}{abcd}.[/imath]\nDone!\n\nI think this problem was designed by you because, the document in which I found it has your name attached beside the problem. Thank You for the solution.\n@Mrigank Shekhar Pathak Yes, you are right! It's my problem and my solution, but an idea with [imath]x\\geq y\\geq z\\geq t[/imath] is not mine.\nso, how you framed it initially.\nHomogenzing the ineq gets us [imath](a+b+c+d)^4\\ge 64(a^2cd+b^2da+c^2ab+d^2bc)[/imath] which exapands to [imath]\\sum a^4+4\\sum a^3b +12\\sum a^2bc \\ge 64(a^2cd+b^2da+c^2ab+d^2bc)[/imath] - no doubt it can be finished off with bunching and muirheading/ weighted AM-GM/ Schur ; but is there a better approach ?\n@rah4927 You missed  [imath]6\\sum\\limits_{cyc}a^2b^2[/imath]. I think would be better if you check my solution.\n\n", "url": "http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2233552/proving-with-am-gm-inequality"}
