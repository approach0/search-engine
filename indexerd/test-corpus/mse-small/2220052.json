{"text": "Find the [imath][\\Bbb{R} ^{\\text{alg}}:\\Bbb{Q}][/imath]\n\nIf we have the field extension [imath]\\Bbb{R}:\\Bbb{Q}[/imath], we define the set \n[imath]\\Bbb{R} ^{\\text{alg}}:=\\{a\\in \\Bbb{R}: a \\text{ is algebraic over }\\Bbb{Q}  \\}[/imath]\nWe want to show that [imath]\\Bbb{R}^{\\text{alg}}[/imath] is a subfield of [imath]\\Bbb{R}[/imath] and find the [imath][\\Bbb{R} ^{\\text{alg}}:\\Bbb{Q}][/imath].\nAnswer: \nIf we consider that [imath]a,b\\in \\Bbb{R} ^{\\text{alg}} \\iff a,b[/imath] are algebraic over [imath]\\Bbb{Q} [/imath], we have that the extension [imath]\\Bbb{Q}(a,b):\\Bbb{Q}[/imath] is algebraic over [imath]\\Bbb{Q}[/imath]. We know that [imath]\\Bbb{Q}(a,b)[/imath] is a field, so [imath]a-b\\in \\Bbb{Q}(a,b)[/imath] and if [imath]b\\neq 0,\\ ab^{-1} \\in \\Bbb{Q}(a,b)[/imath], and from the previous observation are algebraic. So, [imath]a-b,\\ ab^{-1} \\in \\Bbb{R}^{\\text{alg}}[/imath]. And this means [imath]\\Bbb{R}^{\\text{alg}} \\leq\\mathbb{R}[/imath]. \nRight? \nAnd how can we find the [imath][\\Bbb{R} ^{\\text{alg}}:\\Bbb{Q}][/imath]?\nThank you in advance.\n\nDo you have any guesses about what [imath][\\Bbb R^{\\rm alg}:\\Bbb Q][/imath] might be?\n@arctictern Thank you for your comment. Maybe [imath]\\infty[/imath]? But I can't find a way to determine a basis!\nWho said anything about determining a basis?\nSee this question: math.stackexchange.com/questions/552220/\u2026\nFind a lower bound on the degree of the extension by finding appropriate subfields. Show that you can take this lower bound to be as large as you want.\n\n", "url": "http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2220052/find-the-bbbr-textalg-bbbq"}
