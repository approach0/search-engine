{"text": "Proof of F in the domain of a Frechet Type cdfs?\n\nI'm studying order statistics and I came across this exercise.\nI want to verify that:  \n[imath] F_{m,n} \\in D(G_{1}) [/imath]  \n([imath]F[/imath] is in the max-domain of atraction of [imath]G_{1}[/imath]).\nBy definition,  \n[imath]G_{1}(x) = \n\\begin{cases} e^{-x^{-\\alpha}} && x>0, & \\alpha>0 \\\\\n               0 & & x \\le 0\n\\end{cases} [/imath]\nAnd by theorem I know that [imath] F \\in D(G_{1}) \\iff x^{*} = \\infty [/imath] and there exits an [imath]x>0[/imath] such that:  \n[imath] \\frac{1-F(tx)}{1-F(t)} \\longrightarrow x^{-\\alpha}[/imath]\\mbox{ as } t \\longrightarrow \\infty, \\ \\  \\forall x >0 .[imath]  \nWith [/imath]x^{*}[imath] being the right end point of [/imath]F_{x}[imath], [/imath]\\ x^{*}= \\sup\\{x:F_{x}(x)<1 \\}[imath]\nMy approach is trying to set [/imath]F(x)[imath] in that to the explicit form of [/imath]F_{m,n}(x)[imath] in the following way:\n[/imath]\\frac{m!}{(n-m)!(m-1)!}F(x)^{n-m}(1-F(x))^{m-1} [imath]\nBut I'm not really sure how to get a function of [/imath]x", "url": "http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2238552/proof-of-f-in-the-domain-of-a-frechet-type-cdfs"}
