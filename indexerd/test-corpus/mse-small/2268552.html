Show that [imath]p'X_{1}(H)+q'X_{1}(T)=0[/imath] in a one-period binary stock market</br></br>Considering a one-period binary stock market with initial stock price [imath]S_{0}[/imath]. An investor buys a certain fraction [imath]\delta _{0}[/imath] of stock and a certain fraction [imath]\gamma _{0}[/imath] of an option thus the portfolio of the investor after one period is worth</br>[imath]X_{1}=\delta_{0}S_{1}+\gamma_{0}V_{1}-R_{0}(\delta_{0}S_{0}+v_{0}\gamma_{0})[/imath]   </br>where [imath]V_{0}[/imath] is the fair price of the option and [imath]V_{1}[/imath] the value of the option at the end of the period.</br>I now want to show that [imath]p'X_{1}(H)+q'X_{1}(T)=0[/imath], with [imath]p'[/imath] and [imath]q'[/imath] corresponding to the risk-neutral probability (NOTE:[imath]p'=1-q')[/imath].</br> I don't really know what to do here I have tried setting [imath]X_{1}=V_{1}[/imath] and [imath]X_{0}=V_{0}[/imath] (because we know it is fair) and then substituting it in [imath]p'X_{1}(H)+q'X_{1}(T)[/imath] but that didn't really get me anywhere can someone help me with this?</br></br></br>
