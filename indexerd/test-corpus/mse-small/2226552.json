{"text": "A cute question on group action\n\nLet [imath]G[/imath] be a subgroup of [imath]S_n[/imath] that acts transitively on [imath](1,2,...,n)[/imath]. Let [imath]N[/imath] be a non trivial normal subgroup of [imath]G[/imath]. Does [imath]N[/imath] act transitively on the set? Its true when [imath]n[/imath] is prime.\n\nI meant on the set.Extremely sorry for the careless mistake.\nYeah actually i edited p to n...its true for prime....i made a mistake while editing the question\nThis is Example [imath]3.11[/imath] in Keith Conrad's text here. I suppose it is not true in general.\nYeah I want an explicit counterexample if there is one.\nExamples are not exactly hard to find! Groups of order [imath]4[/imath] with [imath]n=4[/imath] for example. What is true is that the orbits of [imath]N[/imath] all have the same length.\n\nTake any non-simple group [imath]A[/imath], and let it act on itself by left translations. If [imath]A[/imath] has [imath]n[/imath] elements, this allows you to think of [imath]A[/imath] as a subgroup of [imath]S_n[/imath]. Now consider any proper non-trivial normal subgroup [imath]B[/imath] of [imath]A[/imath]. \n\nThis shows that pretty much any group is a counterexample.\n\nThis is not true in general - it won't be true for any non-prime Abelian group for example. I'll use [imath]C_4[/imath] (cyclic group with 4 elements) to demonstrate.\n[imath]C_4[/imath] can be identified as the subgroup of [imath]S_4[/imath] generated by [imath](1,2,3,4)[/imath]. This is clearly transitive and has normal subgroup generated by [imath](1,3)(2,4)[/imath] which has two distinct orbits. \nHowever if you further assume that [imath]G[/imath] is primitive, then [imath]N[/imath] must act transitively.\n\n\n", "url": "http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2226552/a-cute-question-on-group-action"}
