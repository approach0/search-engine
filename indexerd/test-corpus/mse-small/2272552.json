{"text": "uniform convergence & puntual convergence\n\nWhich are all the differences between uniform convergence and puntual convergence of a sequence of functions {[imath]f_n[/imath]} in a compact space?\nI know one difference between them, the uniform converge of [imath]f_n[/imath] to [imath]f[/imath] doesn't depend of the point x, whereas puntual convergence does.\nDoes anyone know about other differences between the convergences?\n\nuniform convergence preserves properties like continuity and also interchanging of differentiation/integration operators with limit operator is possible\nAlso I think there's no big difference with their definitions. Confuses me\nThere is actually. Because puntual convergence just gives u the behaviour of the functions at one point but not on the whole. For example take [imath]f_n:[0,1]\\rightarrow [0,1] [/imath] where [imath]f_n(x)=x^n[/imath] then work out the puntual limit of [imath]f_n[/imath] and u'll see the limit function suddenly becomes discontinuous. Uniform convergence implies the graphs of the functions will get closer and closer.\n\"puntual\"? Is that a thing? \"pointwise\" is what I've always heard it called.\n@Nick I think it's the same..it's just my bad translation\n\nI guess you were to understand the difference in the requirements of the two modes of convergence of a sequence of functions. Let [imath]X \\neq \\varnothing[/imath]; let [imath](M,d)[/imath] be a metric space; let [imath]f_{n}: X \\to M[/imath] for all integers [imath]n \\geq 1[/imath]; let [imath]f: X \\to M[/imath]. Then the sequence [imath](f_{n})[/imath] is said to converge pointwisely to [imath]f[/imath] iff for every [imath]x \\in X[/imath] and every [imath]\\varepsilon > 0[/imath] there is some integer [imath]N \\geq 1[/imath] such that [imath]n \\geq N[/imath] implies [imath]d(f_{n}(x),f(x)) < \\varepsilon[/imath]. Clearly, pointwise convergence of [imath]f_{n}[/imath] to [imath]f[/imath] requires simply that at every point [imath]x[/imath] of [imath]X[/imath] the sequence [imath](f_{n}(x))[/imath] of real numbers converges to the real number [imath]f(x)[/imath]. From this you can also tell why mathematicians use a word such as \"pointwise\" or \"punctual\" to modify such a mode of convergence. On the other hand, the sequence [imath](f_{n})[/imath] is said to converge to [imath]f[/imath] uniformly iff for every [imath]\\varepsilon > 0[/imath] there is some integer [imath]N \\geq 1[/imath] such that [imath]n \\geq N[/imath] implies [imath]d(f_{n}(x),f(x)) < \\varepsilon[/imath] for all [imath]x \\in X[/imath]. Now uniform convergence of [imath](f_{n})[/imath] to [imath]f[/imath] instead requires that [imath]f_{n}[/imath] should be arbitrarily close to [imath]f[/imath] if [imath]n[/imath] is large enough. \nIf [imath]X, M := \\mathbb{R}[/imath], then intuitively graphically you can see that uniform convergence of [imath](f_{n})[/imath] to [imath]f[/imath] requires that the graph of each [imath]f_{n}[/imath] with [imath]n[/imath] large enough should be arbitrarily close to the graph of [imath]f[/imath]. However, pointwise convergence of [imath](f_{n})[/imath] to [imath]f[/imath] does not require that much. \n\n\n", "url": "http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2272552/uniform-convergence-puntual-convergence"}
