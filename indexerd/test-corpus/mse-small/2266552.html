Asymptote to graph of solution to [imath]60y' = y[12 - y][/imath]</br></br>[imath]60P'(t) = P(t)[12 - P(t)][/imath], and [imath]P(0) = 3[/imath]. What is the horizontal asymptote for the graph of the function [imath]P(t)[/imath]?  The answer is "[imath]y = 12[/imath]."  The answer is the same if the initial condition is [imath]20[/imath] or [imath]100[/imath].  What is the solution to the differential equation?</br></br></br>Let [imath]y=P(t)[/imath]. Then </br>[imath]\begin{align}60y'=y(12-y)&\implies\frac{60}{y(12-y)}\frac{dy}{dt}=1\tag1\\</br>\int\frac5y+\frac{5}{12-y}dy&=\int dt\tag2\\</br>5\log y-5\log(12-y)&=t+c\tag3\\</br>\log\frac{12-y}{y}&=-\frac15t+c\tag4\\</br>12-y&=Aye^{-t/5}\tag5\\</br>y&=\frac{12}{1+Ae^{-t/5}}\tag6\end{align}[/imath]</br>As [imath]t\to\infty[/imath], [imath]y\to \frac{12}{1+Ae^{-"\infty"}}=\frac{12}{1+0}=12.[/imath]</br>Also notice that the initial condition allows us to determine [imath]A[/imath], which has no affect on this asymptote, as you noted, since [imath]Ae^{-t/5}\to0[/imath] as [imath]t\to\infty[/imath] regardless of [imath]A[/imath].</br>Steps:</br>[imath](1)[/imath] - Re-arrange differential equation</br>[imath](2)[/imath] - Split into partial fractions, integral signs</br>[imath](3)[/imath] - integrate</br>[imath](4)[/imath] - log rules</br>[imath](5)[/imath] and [imath](6)[/imath] - rearrange</br></br>Nice explanation!</br>My post was part a.) of a past AP Calculus test.  Part b.) is to find the value of the function at which the function is growing the fastest if P(0)=3.  The solution provided says "half of the maximum population is when the population is growing the fastest, and lim P(t) = 12.  So, when the function value is 6, the function is growing the fastest."  That was it.</br>@user74973 I am not sure about the method you mentioned. This is how I would do it. If [imath]P(0)=3[/imath], then [imath]A=3[/imath]. [imath]P(t)=\frac{12}{1+3e^{-t/5}}\implies P'(t)=\frac{36e^{-t/5}}{5(1+3e^{-t/5})^2}\implies P''(t)=-\frac{36e^{-t/5}(1-3e^{-t/5})}{25(1+3e^{-t/5})^3}[/imath]  This is zero when [imath]e^{-t/5}=\frac13\implies t=5\log 3[/imath].  Then [imath]P(5\log3)=\frac{12}{1+1}=6.[/imath]</br>Yes, this is the way I got the answer while waiting for your reply.  Thanks.</br>You have an error in your definition of [imath]P^{\prime\prime}[/imath].  The numerator should have 108 and not 36.  (I had supposed that [imath]P(0) = 1[/imath] when I defined [imath]P^{\prime}[/imath] and [imath]P^{\prime\prime}[/imath].  This is a mistake.  In the post, I specify [imath]P(0) = 3[/imath].)</br></br>
