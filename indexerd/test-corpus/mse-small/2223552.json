{"text": "Is the Kronecker or Hadamard product of many Positive Semi-Definite Hermitian matrices also PSD Hermitian? [closed]\n\nIf I have [imath]n[/imath] Hermitian Positive Semi-Definite matrices [imath]A_1, A_2 ... A_n[/imath], does there exist any type of product (viz. Kronecker, Hadamard, Tracy-Singh, etc.) that gives back a  Hermitian Positive Semi-Definite matrix.\nThis question appears to be off-topic.

The Schur product (aka Hadamard) works, by a theorem of Schur.\n\nThank you! I wrote a small code to generate a 100 random PSDH matrices, and do the product and check. It worked but I was looking to make sure it was mathematically sound :)\n\n", "url": "http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2223552/is-the-kronecker-or-hadamard-product-of-many-positive-semi-definite-hermitian-ma"}
