{"text": "Expected value of random variable for two dice\n\nWe have a fair four-sided dice with faces labeled 0, 1, 2, 3. We roll the dice n times; each roll is independent. Let [imath]X_{i}[/imath] be the face that comes up on the [imath]i[/imath]th die\nLet [imath] Y = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\sum_{j=1}^n X_{i}X_{j}[/imath]  \nDetermine [imath]E[Y][/imath]  \nI've already determined that the [imath]E[X_{i}] = 1.5[/imath] and that the [imath]Var[X_{i}] = 1.25[/imath].\nHowever, I'm not sure how to calculate the expected value of [imath]E[Y][/imath]. Could I break it up into [imath]E[X_{i}]E[X_{j}][/imath]? If I can, would the answer be 3.0? Thanks.\n\nThe question doesn't specify that they can't, so I'm assuming that they can.\n\nIf [imath]i \\ne j[/imath] then independence allows you to write [imath]E[X_i X_j] = E[X_i] E[X_j][/imath]. If [imath]i=j[/imath] then [imath]E[X_i X_j]=E[X_i^2][/imath]. So you need to handle the terms in the double sum differently, depending on the two cases above.\n\n\nHint:\n[imath] Y = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\sum_{j=1}^n X_{i}X_{j}=(X_1+ \\dots+ X_n)^2[/imath] \n\nThank you. So the answer would be 3.5?\nThe answer will depend on n\n\n", "url": "http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2269052/expected-value-of-random-variable-for-two-dice"}
