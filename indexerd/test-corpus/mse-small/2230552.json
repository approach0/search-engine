{"text": "Determinant and determinant function(explanation)\n\n1) A determinant function on [imath]n[/imath]-dim vector space [imath]V[/imath] is map [imath]\\Delta: V*V*V*\\dots*V \\to K[/imath] with two properties:\ndeterminant function is [imath]n[/imath]-multilinear;\nif determinant function has in input two equal vectors, than determinant function is 0.\n2) Suppose [imath]V[/imath] is [imath]n[/imath]-dim [imath]K[/imath]-vector space and [imath]f \\in \\mathrm{End}_k(V)[/imath]. Choose [imath]0 \\neq A \\in \\Lambda^n V^*[/imath] and define [imath]\\Delta f[/imath] as \n[imath]\n\\Delta f = \\Delta(f(a_1),\\dots,f(a_n)) \\implies \\exists \\,\\det(f) \\in K: \\Delta f = (\\det(f))\\Delta.\n[/imath]\nThe scalar [imath]\\det(f)[/imath] is determinant of [imath]f[/imath].\nMaybe it's a weird question, but I cannot connect and intuitive understand definitions of determinant function and determinant. As I understood, determinant function takes set of vectors(matrix) and returns scalar.\nBut what does the formula [imath](\\det(f))\\Delta[/imath] mean? what is [imath]\\Delta f[/imath] and why does the relationship [imath]\\Delta f = (\\det(f))\\Delta[/imath] hold?\nCan you provide also the intuition?\n\nLooking at this question, it looks like most of your confusion will be cleared up when you reach the end of the chapter. [imath]\\Delta f[/imath] is defined here. There's a lot I don't understand here (what does the lambda mean, and what function does [imath]A[/imath] have, etc) But there exists only one determinant function. It seems like you're making preparations to prove that, so maybe that will give some context?\nYou must have made a mistake in transcribing 2), as it makes no sense. First, you have not explained what the [imath]a_i[/imath] and their relation to [imath]A[/imath] are. I assume [imath]a_i \\in V[/imath], to make sense of [imath]\\Delta((f(a_1),\\ldots,f(a_n))[/imath], which is a scalar; but then there is no way for this scalar to be equal to [imath]\\det(f) \\Delta[/imath], which is a multilinear map. It would be best if you included a link to the original reference.\n\n", "url": "http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2230552/determinant-and-determinant-functionexplanation"}
