{"text": "Why is this map in relative homology given by multiplication by squaring the generator?\n\nLet [imath]N[/imath] denote a four manifold that is exact filling of [imath]Y[/imath], the unit cotangent bundle of a surface of genus [imath]g>1[/imath] (I suspect not all of these details will be relevant). Then one can show that [imath]H_2(N) = \\langle S \\rangle \\cong \\mathbb{Z}[/imath] (where all homologies in this question are assumed to have integer coefficients). My question is, why is the induced map on the LES of a pair [imath]H_2(N) \\to H_2(N,Y)[/imath] multiplication by [imath][S]^2[/imath]? I know it's determined by where it sends the generator. Could this be some kind of application of Poincar\u00e9 Duality?\nBackground: I'm reading Calabi Yau Caps, Uniruled Caps, and Symplectic Fillings and I'm referencing the end of the proof on page 20. \n\n\n", "url": "http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2285552/why-is-this-map-in-relative-homology-given-by-multiplication-by-squaring-the-gen"}
