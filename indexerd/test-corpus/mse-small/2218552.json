{"text": "Question regarding Modules\n\nLet [imath] A [/imath] be the ring [imath] \\mathbb C[X,Y]/(XY) [/imath].\n(a) Let [imath] S [/imath] be an invertible [imath] d \\times d [/imath] matrix. Suppose we make [imath] V = \\mathbb C^d [/imath] and [imath] A [/imath] module by having [imath] X [/imath] act via the matrix [imath] S [/imath]. Find all possible matrices T via which [imath] Y [/imath] can act in such a way that [imath] V [/imath] becomes and [imath] A- [/imath] module.\n(b) Suppose [imath] S=\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3  \\\\ 4 & 5 & 6 \\\\ 7 & 8 & 9 \\end{pmatrix}[/imath]. Find all possible matrices [imath] T [/imath] via which [imath] Y [/imath] can act on [imath] V = \\mathbb C^3 [/imath] so that [imath] V [/imath] becomes an [imath] A- [/imath] module.\nNot sure how to get started. Any help is much appreciated. Thanks in advance for any replies.\n\n\nWelcome to Math.StackExchange! \n(And thanks for taking the time to properly format and typeset your question right from the beginning).\nI'll give a hint on (a), maybe that'll also help to solve (b): Suppose [imath]V[/imath] carries an [imath]A[/imath]-module structure. Then, by the very definition, [imath]X,Y\\in A[/imath] act on [imath]V[/imath] as [imath]{\\mathbb C}[/imath]-linear endomorphisms, say [imath]\\alpha,\\beta[/imath]. Moreover, again following the definition, the relation [imath]XY=0[/imath] in [imath]A[/imath] between [imath]X,Y[/imath] must hold between their actions on [imath]V[/imath] as well, so [imath]\\alpha\\circ\\beta=0[/imath] as endomorphisms of [imath]V[/imath]. Now suppose that [imath]\\alpha[/imath] is invertible on [imath]V[/imath]; what does [imath]\\alpha\\circ\\beta=0[/imath] then imply on [imath]\\beta[/imath]? \nFor (b), the strategy is the same, but the choice of possible [imath]\\beta[/imath] is less restrictive. Note also that [imath]\\alpha[/imath] and [imath]\\beta[/imath] must commute, [imath]\\alpha\\circ\\beta = \\beta\\circ\\alpha[/imath], since the same holds in [imath]A[/imath].\n\n\n", "url": "http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2218552/question-regarding-modules"}
