{"text": "Find vector pointing left\n\nLets say I have two vectors\nI want to find the vector which is pointing from right to left of the object.\nObviously, the vector is either [imath]cross(bottomToTop, footToHead)[/imath] or [imath](-1)* cross(bottomToTop, footToHead)[/imath] but I have not figured out to distinguish between the two. How would you do that?\nAs an illustration of the situation, please have a look at this picture:\n\n\nI don't really understand your application, but if you want to determine the orientation of the vector resulting from the cross product, you can search up the well known \"right-hand rule\". When doing the right-hand rule, your thumb should point in the direction of [imath](bottomToTop \\times footToHead)[/imath], so you can determine if that is the correct direction, or if you need to multiply by [imath](-1)[/imath] to correct it.\nhi! yes, handedness actually came to my mind, but I have not figured out how to test the handedness programmatically.\nWhat\u2019s the difference between bottom-to-top and foot-to-head? They\u2019re synonymous to me. An illustration of the situation might get you a usable answer.\n@amd I have added an illustration, hope that clarifies things\n\nYou'd obviously want to scale such a vector, but if 'up' is positive [imath]x[/imath], 'forward' is positive [imath]y[/imath], and 'right' is positive 'z', then your vector should be [imath]- ( bottomToTop \\times footToHead)[/imath].\n\nOP's diagram (and the label \"rightToLeft\") suggest that left is \"positive [imath]z[/imath]\". ;)\nIt would seem that way, but I suspect that OP is working in some sort of graphics framework, in which case right is probably defined as 'positive z'.\n\n", "url": "http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2245052/find-vector-pointing-left"}
