{"text": "Solve [imath]x^{247} \\equiv y \\pmod {2016}[/imath]\n\nI asked a question like this earlier but I'm looking for a more general answer. \nSolve:\n[imath]x^{247} \\equiv y \\pmod {2016}[/imath]\nI know you have to use the Euclidean algorithm but I'm not sure how.\nI know the prime factorization of 2016 is [imath]2^5 \\times 3^2 \\times7[/imath].\nAdditionally, I know that [imath]\\phi (2016)[/imath]=576. \n\nFor the case [imath]\\gcd(y,2016)=1[/imath]  we have [imath]\\gcd(x,2016)=1,[/imath]  so [imath]\\gcd(x,2^5(=\\gcd (x,3^2)=\\gcd(x,7)=1.[/imath]...... (1). Modulo [imath]2^5[/imath], we have  [imath]x^8\\equiv 1[/imath] so [imath]x^{247}\\equiv y  \\iff x^7\\equiv y\\iff 1\\equiv x^8\\equiv xy.[/imath] ..... (2). Modulo [imath]3^2[/imath]  we have  [imath]x^6\\equiv 1[/imath] so [imath]x^{247}\\equiv y\\iff x\\equiv y.[/imath] .... (3). Modulo [imath]7[/imath] we have [imath]x^6\\equiv 1[/imath] so [imath]x^{247}\\equiv y\\iff x\\equiv y[/imath]... The method of proof of the Chinese Remainder Theorem provides an algorithm for finding all [imath]x[/imath]  that satisfy these three conditions.\nwe can use mathworld.wolfram.com/CarmichaelFunction.html [imath]\\lambda(2016)=24[/imath] See also : math.stackexchange.com/questions/2281562/\u2026\n\nFirst, some introduction : \nTonelli-shanks algorithm can solve this problem [imath]x^2 = b \\mod p[/imath] for [imath]p[/imath] prime number, also can be generalized for [imath]n[/imath] composite.\nFor the general case [imath]x^a = b \\mod p[/imath]  its easy solve-able if [imath]gcd(a,p-1)=1[/imath] and [imath](b,p)=1[/imath] and it becomes very complicated when the condition fails (yet there are many papers dealing with this situation on arXiv), and this can be generalized to [imath]n[/imath] composite by using [imath]\\phi(n)[/imath] where [imath]\\phi(n)[/imath] is the Euler function.\nIn your case [imath]gcd(247,\\phi(2016)=576)=1[/imath], so its easily solve-able if [imath]gcd(y,2016)=1[/imath] which means that [imath]2\\not| y[/imath] and [imath]3\\not|y[/imath] and [imath]7\\not|y[/imath].\nIts simply by this equation [imath]x=y^{7} \\mod 2016[/imath], the reason for this is that [imath]247^{-1} = 7 \\mod \\phi(2016)=576[/imath].(Read about why this works given the above conditions in the internet).\nFor Example : [imath]x^{247} = 131\\mod 2016[/imath] and since [imath]gcd(131,2016)=1[/imath], the solution is [imath]x = 131^{7} = 1643 \\mod 2016[/imath] so [imath]x=1643[/imath].\nNote there is more than one solution [imath]-x \\mod 2016[/imath] is also a solution and there might be more solutions.\n\nThat's incorrect. [imath]1643^{247} mod 2016 \\equiv 131[/imath] not [imath]5[/imath]\n@shrindle [imath]5^{7} \\mod 2016 = 1517 \\not= 1643[/imath], so were is the problem ?\n\n", "url": "http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2283052/solve-x247-equiv-y-pmod-2016"}
