{"text": "A variation on square-freeness of Euclid numbers\n\nAs pointed out by Jeppe Stig Nielsen, my previous question A question about numbers from Euclid's proof of infinitude of primes actually can be viewed as a duplicate of Are Euclid numbers squarefree?\nI then thought - maybe a simplified version could be more accessible. Let us modify Euclid's argument for infinitude of primes like this. Having discovered some primes [imath]p_1,...,p_n[/imath], we look at [imath]p_1\\cdot...\\cdot p_n+1[/imath]; all of its prime factors are new, [imath]p_{n+1},...,p_{n+m}[/imath]; we then look at [imath]p_1\\cdot...\\cdot p_{n+m}+1[/imath], etc.\nThe point is that this procedure is equivalent to something simpler: define recurrently [imath]N_1=2[/imath] and [imath]N_{n+1}=N_n(N_n-1)+1[/imath]. We obtain\n[imath]\n\\begin{aligned}\nN_1&=2\\\\\nN_2&=3\\\\\nN_3&=7\\\\\nN_4&=43\\\\\nN_5&=1807=13\\cdot139\\\\\nN_6&=3263443\\\\\nN_7&=10650056950807=547\\cdot607\\cdot1033\\cdot31051\\\\\nN_8&=113423713055421844361000443=29881\\cdot67003\\cdot9119521\\cdot6212157481\n\\end{aligned}\n[/imath]\n(by construction, every next number only contains new primes, not previously occurring on the list).\nThe question now is similar to that in the linked questions: are all these numbers squarefree? Are there any more primes in this list?\nAnd an additional question: will all primes eventually occur as factors somewhere on the list?\n\nNot all primes are in the list. [imath]N_6 \\mod 17 = 4, N_7 \\mod 17 = 13[/imath]. From there on the modulus cycles through 4 and 13\n@MichaelStocker Great idea! I checked other primes up to 71, the same applies to all of them - they generate quite short periods, the longest has 31 (length 9). Seems like if a prime [imath]p[/imath] does not appear until [imath]p[/imath]th step it does not have any chance.\n\n", "url": "http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2201052/a-variation-on-square-freeness-of-euclid-numbers"}
