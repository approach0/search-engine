Continuity and pointwise convergence doesn't imply contiunity</br></br>We have a function [imath]f[/imath] and a sequence of functions [imath]f_n[/imath], both on [imath][a,b] \to \mathbb{R}[/imath]. [imath]f_n[/imath] is continuous for each [imath]n \in \mathbb{N}[/imath], and [imath]f_n[/imath] converges pointwise to [imath]f[/imath]. I am asked to give an example to show this does not imply that [imath]f[/imath] is continuous. </br>My thinking so far is that the example must break down on the boundaries, since within [imath](a,b)[/imath], we pick the same [imath]\epsilon>0[/imath] for both definitions of continuity and pointwise convergence, we get an epsilon-delta rectangle about each point which both [imath]f_n(x)[/imath] and [imath]f(x)[/imath] must be in, so as epsilon shrinks we can define a slightly larger epsilon to get continuity of [imath]f[/imath]. </br>I can't get an example where it breaks though.</br>Is my reasoning sound, and any hints for getting an example that breaks this?</br></br>[imath]f_n:[0,1]\ni x\mapsto x^n[/imath]</br>The issue doesn't need to happen on the boundary, but it can.  Think about [imath][0,1][/imath] and the function [imath]f_n(x)[/imath] is [imath]1[/imath] for [imath]x<1/n[/imath], the function is [imath]0[/imath] for [imath]x>2/n[/imath], and connected by a line between those two regions to make the function continuous.</br>It could also break at points other than the boundary.  An example can be easily constructed from Vim's.  Define the functions on [imath][0, 1][/imath] as Vim's and reflect them into [imath][1, 2][/imath].</br></br>As pointed out in the comments, the problem may be at boundaries or it may not. </br>Considering [imath]a=0[/imath], [imath]b=1[/imath] and [imath]f_n\colon x\mapsto x^n[/imath], the sequence converges pointwise to the function [imath]f[/imath] such that [imath]f(x)=0[/imath] for [imath]0\leqslant x\lt 1[/imath] and [imath]f(1)=1[/imath], which is not continuous.</br>Let [imath]a=0[/imath], [imath]b=1[/imath], [imath]f_n[/imath] equal to [imath]1[/imath] on [imath][0,1/2-1/n)[/imath], [imath]-1[/imath] on [imath](1/2+1/n,1] [/imath] and linear on [imath](1/2-1/n,1/2+1/n)[/imath]. Then [imath]f_n[/imath] is continuous and converges pointwise to [imath]f[/imath], which equals [imath]1[/imath] on [imath][0,1/2)[/imath], [imath]-1[/imath] on [imath](1/2,1][/imath] and [imath]0[/imath] at [imath]1/2[/imath], which is not continuous.    </br></br></br>
