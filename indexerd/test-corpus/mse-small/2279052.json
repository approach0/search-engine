It doesn't matter whether [imath]A[/imath] is thought of as a subspace of some larger space; in this context that larger space does not exist for our intents and purposes.\nSo in our case, when we have a function [imath]f:\\Bbb Q\\to \\Bbb R[/imath], you must forget that [imath]\\Bbb Q[/imath] is a part of [imath]\\Bbb R[/imath], and just look at [imath]\\Bbb Q[/imath] as a topological space in its own right.\n\n\n", "url": "http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2279052/continuous-function-from-subspace-mathbbq-to-mathbbr"}
