{"text": "Why we can replace ab=(ab)^-1\n\nWhy we can replace [imath]ab=(ab)^{-1}[/imath]\nI saw prove of if every element is its own inverse then the group is abelian.\nAnd there is equality like this:\n[imath]a\u00b7b = (a\u00b7b)^{\u22121} =b^{\u22121}\u00b7a^{\u22121} = b\u00b7a[/imath]\nI dont understand that first equality what is the reason why we can write this?\n\nIt is simply because [imath]ab[/imath] is an element of the group and this element has the property to be its own inverse.\nYes, what you've written seems to utilize the premise three times.\n@Tucker could u explain what u mean because im new in abstract algebra and i dont get it\n\nIf every element [imath]g[/imath] of a group [imath]\\mathcal{G}[/imath], is its own inverse then if [imath]g\\in\\mathcal{G}[/imath], we can immediately conclude [imath]g=g^{-1}[/imath]. One of the properties of a group is that it is closed under the binary group operation. Given [imath]a,b\\in\\mathcal{G}[/imath], we know [imath]ab\\in\\mathcal{G}[/imath]. Also, we know that [imath]ab[/imath] is its own inverse, which explicitly means that [imath]ab[/imath] and [imath](ab)^{-1}[/imath] are equal.\n[imath]\nab=(ab)^{-1}\n[/imath]\n\n\nSince [imath]ab[/imath] is an element of the group, it is its own inverse, thus [imath]ab=(ab)^{-1}[/imath].\n\n\nIt is given that every element is its own inverse, i.e if [imath]a[/imath] is an element in [imath]G[/imath] then its inverse (say [imath]a^{-1}[/imath] ) is  [imath]a[/imath]. Since G is a group [imath] ab \\in G~~ \\text{for a,b } \\in G.[/imath]\nHence by hypothesis its inverse should be equal to [imath]ab[/imath].\n\n\n", "url": "http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2284552/why-we-can-replace-ab-ab-1"}
