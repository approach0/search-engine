{"text": "transforming bivariate continous variables to uniform distribution\n\nI read a bivariate [imath](X,Y)[/imath]  normally distributed data can be transformed to a bivariate standard uniform distribution by the following steps: \nMy question is that can we generally say that for any bivariate data (regardless the distribution) after standardize and removing the correlation of the two variables  their cdf, [imath]F(X)[/imath] and [imath]F(Y)[/imath], have a joint uniform distribution? If not, can you please explain why?\n\n\n", "url": "http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2264052/transforming-bivariate-continous-variables-to-uniform-distribution"}
