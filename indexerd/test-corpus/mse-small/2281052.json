{"text": "Action of Frobenius maps on root systems\n\nLet [imath]G[/imath] be a connected reductive group defined over a finite field [imath]F_q[/imath] of characteristic [imath]p >0[/imath] with\n[imath]q[/imath] elements and corresponding Frobenius map [imath]F : G \u2192 G[/imath]. Let [imath]T[/imath] be an [imath]F[/imath]-\nstable maximal torus of [imath]G[/imath] contained in an [imath]F[/imath]-stable Borel subgroup [imath]B[/imath] of [imath]G[/imath], and let [imath]\u03a6[/imath] be the root system of [imath]G[/imath] relative to [imath]T[/imath].\nFor [imath]\u03b1 \u2208 \u03a6[/imath], we write [imath]X_\u03b1[/imath] for the unipotent subgroup of [imath]G[/imath] corresponding to [imath]\u03b1[/imath]. That is, [imath]X_\u03b1[/imath] is the\nminimal non-trivial closed unipotent subgroup of [imath]G[/imath] normalized by [imath]T[/imath], such that [imath]T[/imath] acts on [imath]X_\u03b1[/imath] by [imath]\u03b1[/imath],\nwhere [imath]\u03b1[/imath] is viewed as a character of [imath]T[/imath]. Recall that [imath]X_\u03b1[/imath] and [imath](\\overline{F_p},+)[/imath] are isomorphic as algebraic groups.\nFix an automorphism [imath]x_\u03b1 : F_p \u2192X_\u03b1[/imath] for every [imath]\u03b1 \u2208 \u03a6[/imath].\nAssume that [imath]F' : G\u2192G[/imath] be a Frobenius map of [imath]G[/imath] commuting with [imath]F[/imath] such that [imath]T[/imath] and [imath]B[/imath] are [imath]F'[/imath]-stable.\nWe say that [imath]F'[/imath] has property (*) if for every [imath]\u03b1 \u2208 \u03a6[/imath], there is a\n  non-negative integer [imath]m > 0[/imath] such that for all [imath]t \u2208 \\overline{F_p}[/imath] we have [imath]F'(x_\u03b1(t)) = x_{F' (\u03b1)}(t^{p^m}) [/imath].\nMy Question Let's consider [imath]G=SL_n(q)[/imath], and [imath]F': G \\rightarrow G[/imath] be a field automorphism i.e., [imath]F'((a_{ij}))=(a_{ij}^{p^k})[/imath] for some [imath]k\\in N[/imath]. Does [imath]F'[/imath] satisfy the property (*)?My Thoughts: By a result of Steinberg [Endomorphisms of linear algebraic groups, Section 11.2], [imath]F'[/imath] permutes the roots; in fact, [imath]F'[/imath] permutes the root subgroups by [imath]F'(X_{\\alpha})=X_{{\\alpha}'}[/imath] and this gives rise to a permutation [imath]b:\\Phi \\rightarrow \\Phi[/imath], in which [imath]b(\\alpha):={\\alpha}'[/imath]. Moreover, for each [imath]\\alpha \\in \\Phi[/imath], we have [imath]F'(x_{\u03b1}(t)) = x_{b(\u03b1)}(d_{\\alpha} t^{q_{\\alpha}})[/imath] for some [imath]d_\\alpha \\in \\overline{F_p}^*[/imath] and [imath]t\\in \\overline{F_p}^+[/imath]. On the other hand, for groups of type [imath]A_n[/imath], the root subgroups  [imath]X_{\\alpha}[/imath]'s are all of the form [imath]\\lbrace I+ kE_{ij} : k \\in \\overline{F_p}^+ \\rbrace[/imath] for [imath]1\\leq i, j \\leq n[/imath] (where [imath]I[/imath] is identity matrix and [imath]E_{ij}[/imath] is a matrix which is zero everywhere except for the entry [imath]ij[/imath]th). Therefore, according to the definition of [imath]F'[/imath], we have [imath]F'(X_{\\alpha})=X_{{\\alpha}}[/imath] for all [imath]\\alpha[/imath], and this means that the permutation [imath]b[/imath] acts trivially on roots. Hence [imath]F'(x_{\u03b1}(t)) = x_{\u03b1}(d_{\\alpha} t^{q_{\\alpha}})[/imath]. So I am done if I could show that [imath]d_{\\alpha}=1[/imath] for all [imath]\\alpha[/imath]. Is there any way to finish this argument?\n\n\nAn isomorphism [imath]x_\\alpha: \\overline{\\mathbb{F}}_p \\to X_\\alpha[/imath] can always be composed  with an automorphism of [imath]\\overline{\\mathbb{F}_p}[/imath] to give another such isomorphism. Note that [imath]F'(x_\\alpha(d t)) = x_\\alpha(d_\\alpha d^{q_\\alpha} t^{q_\\alpha})[/imath], so you can just choose [imath]d \\in \\overline{\\mathbb{F}_p}^*[/imath] such that [imath]d_\\alpha d^{q_\\alpha} = d[/imath] and replace [imath]x_\\alpha[/imath] by [imath]t \\mapsto x_\\alpha(d t)[/imath] to obtain an [imath]x_\\alpha[/imath] for which [imath]F'[/imath] satisfies property (*).\nHowever, [imath]F'[/imath] will not have property (*) for arbitrary choices of [imath]x_\\alpha[/imath].\n\nI think you meant [imath]d_{\\alpha} d^{q_{\\alpha}}=1[/imath]...Anyway, thank you so much for the answer.\n@user97635 : Actually, no, I mean [imath]d_\\alpha d^{q_\\alpha} = d[/imath]. You want to have [imath]F(x_\\alpha(d t)) = x_\\alpha(d t^{q_\\alpha})[/imath] and since [imath]F(x_\\alpha(d t)) = x_\\alpha(d_\\alpha d^{q_\\alpha} t^{q_\\alpha})[/imath], you need to have [imath]d_\\alpha d^{q_\\alpha} t^{q_\\alpha} = d t^{q_\\alpha}[/imath] for all [imath]t[/imath], hence  [imath]d_\\alpha d^{q_\\alpha} = d[/imath].\n\n", "url": "http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2281052/action-of-frobenius-maps-on-root-systems"}
