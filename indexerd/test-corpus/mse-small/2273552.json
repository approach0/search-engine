{"text": "Prove that the following expression is always less than x for all values of x and k.\n\nProve that  \n[imath]\\frac{x^2+kx}{2x+k}[/imath]\nis less than x for all values of x and k where x>0,  k>0 and k is a constant.\nHow would I prove this? I have differentiated it with respect to x and noticed that the derivative is always less than 1 for all values of x and k, this means that if the value of x increases the value out always increases less than the increase in x.  \n\n+1, but please try and be careful to get things right when writing questions as editing after having gotten answers had can sometimes be interpreted as disrespectful.\n\nMultiplying by [imath]2x+k[/imath] positive, [imath]x^2+kx<x(2x+k)[/imath]\nthen\n[imath]x^2>0.[/imath]\nAlternatively,\n[imath]\\frac{x^2+kx}{2x+k}-x=-\\frac{x^2}{2x+k}<0.[/imath]\n\nSorry I wrote down the expression wrong. Edited.\nI made mistakes myself. Everything fixed now.\n\n", "url": "http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2273552/prove-that-the-following-expression-is-always-less-than-x-for-all-values-of-x-an"}
