{"text": "Prove convergence of random variables\n\nI have a problem with following task:\nWe have [imath]X_1,X_2,...[/imath] independent random variables, that almost surely [imath]X_1\\ge X_2\\ge...\\ge 0[/imath]. Prove that if [imath]X_n\\rightarrow0[/imath] converges in probability then [imath]X_n\\rightarrow0[/imath] converges almost surely. I am hitting a wall with this one. I will be very glad for as simple as possible explanation. \n\nAs [imath]X_n[/imath] is decreasing a.s., it converges a.s. to the limit inferior. Convergence a.s. implies convergence in probability and limits are unique a.s.\n\nLet [imath]u_i[/imath] be the essential supremum of [imath]X_i[/imath], i.e. the least constant [imath]c[/imath] such that [imath]X_i \\le c[/imath] a.s.  If [imath]X_{i-1}[/imath] and [imath]X_i[/imath] are independent but [imath]X_{i-1} \\ge X_i[/imath] a.s., then [imath]c_i[/imath] must exist and [imath]X_{i-1} \\ge c_i \\ge X_i[/imath] a.s.  Show that \nif [imath]X_i \\to 0[/imath] in probability, [imath]c_i \\to 0[/imath]. \n\n\n", "url": "http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2294052/prove-convergence-of-random-variables"}
