{"text": "Does the distributional derivative of the Dirac Comb have the same properties as a single Dirac Delta?\n\nA single Dirac delta has a distributional derivative [imath]\\delta'[/imath] defined in the sense that\n[imath]\n\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\textrm{d}x \\, \\delta'(x) \\, \\phi(x) = -\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\textrm{d}x \\, \\delta(x) \\, \\phi'(x) \\, .\n[/imath]\nI understand this comes from the integral of the total derivative of [imath]\\delta(x) \\, \\phi(x)[/imath] vanishing,\n[imath]\n\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\textrm{d}x \\, \\frac{\\textrm{d}}{\\textrm{d} x} \\big( \\delta(x) \\, \\phi(x) \\big) = \\delta(x) \\, \\phi(x) \\, \\big|_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} = 0 \\, ,\n[/imath]\nwhich means the product rule for differentation gives the above expression defining [imath]\\delta'[/imath]. If we instead consider the Dirac comb\n[imath]\n\\mathrm{III}(t) = \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\, \\delta(x - kT) \\, ,\n[/imath]\nwhich is periodic with period [imath]T[/imath], is the same total derivative trick valid -\n[imath]\n\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\textrm{d}x \\, \\frac{\\textrm{d}}{\\textrm{d} x} \\big( \\textrm{III}(x) \\, \\phi(x) \\big) = 0 \\, ?\n[/imath]\nAllowing us to define the distributional derivative of the Dirac comb analogously to the Dirac delta\n[imath]\n\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\textrm{d}x \\, \\textrm{III}'(x) \\, \\phi(x) = -\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\textrm{d}x \\, \\textrm{III}(x) \\, \\phi'(x) \\, .\n[/imath]\n\n\nIn fact, if stop reasoning in terms of integrals ans start reasoning in terms of distributions and distributional derivatives, then this result is quite easy to show. Let us note [imath]\\phi [/imath] - am arbitrary test function (i.e. compactly supported and [imath]C^\\infty[/imath])\nWe start with a delta-distribution [imath]\\delta_p[/imath] given by \n[imath]\\langle \\delta_p,\\phi\\rangle = \\phi(p)[/imath]\n and its derivative [imath]\\delta_p'[/imath], for which the definition of distributional derivative (yes, it has common roots with integration by parts) gives\n[imath]\\langle \\delta_p' ,\\phi\\rangle=-\\langle \\delta_p,\\phi'\\rangle = -\\phi'(p).[/imath]\nNow the Dirac comb [imath]B = \\sum_{k\\in\\Bbb Z} \\delta_{kT}[/imath] is a well-defined distribution, because [imath]\\langle B,\\phi\\rangle = \\sum_{k\\in\\Bbb Z} \\phi(kT),[/imath] and the latter series converges because [imath]\\phi[/imath] is compactly supported. I will omit the continuity part of the definition, it is an easy exercise.\nSince [imath]B[/imath] is a distribution, it has a distributional derivative - it is one of the major resons to use distributions. Moreover, we have an explicit definition:\n[imath]\\langle B',\\phi\\rangle=-\\langle B,\\phi'\\rangle = -\\sum_{k\\in\\Bbb Z} \\phi'(kT),[/imath]\nand the latter series converges for the exact same reasons as we mentioned earlier.\nFinally, by testing against all possible test functions [imath]\\phi[/imath] you can conclude that [imath]B'[/imath] has the form [imath] \\sum_{k\\in\\Bbb Z} \\delta'_{kT}[/imath].\n===\nAnother approach would be to show that the distributions [imath]B_n= \\sum_{k\\in\\Bbb Z,\\,|k|\\le n} \\delta_{kT}[/imath] converge to [imath]B[/imath] in the distributional sense (easy to show by definition of this convergence). It implies - another great property of distributional derivatives - that [imath]B'_n[/imath] converges to [imath]B'[/imath], and the explicit formula for [imath]B'_n[/imath] is quite obvious.\n\nWell done.  And it is good to see one dispel the notion that the Dirac Delta is a distribution and not a function, and that the linear functional [imath]\\langle \\phi,\\delta\\rangle[/imath] is not an integral.
