Why we can replace ab=(ab)^-1</br></br>Why we can replace [imath]ab=(ab)^{-1}[/imath]</br>I saw prove of if every element is its own inverse then the group is abelian.</br>And there is equality like this:</br>[imath]a·b = (a·b)^{−1} =b^{−1}·a^{−1} = b·a[/imath]</br>I dont understand that first equality what is the reason why we can write this?</br></br>It is simply because [imath]ab[/imath] is an element of the group and this element has the property to be its own inverse.</br>Yes, what you've written seems to utilize the premise three times.</br>@Tucker could u explain what u mean because im new in abstract algebra and i dont get it</br></br>If every element [imath]g[/imath] of a group [imath]\mathcal{G}[/imath], is its own inverse then if [imath]g\in\mathcal{G}[/imath], we can immediately conclude [imath]g=g^{-1}[/imath]. One of the properties of a group is that it is closed under the binary group operation. Given [imath]a,b\in\mathcal{G}[/imath], we know [imath]ab\in\mathcal{G}[/imath]. Also, we know that [imath]ab[/imath] is its own inverse, which explicitly means that [imath]ab[/imath] and [imath](ab)^{-1}[/imath] are equal.</br>[imath]</br>ab=(ab)^{-1}</br>[/imath]</br></br></br>Since [imath]ab[/imath] is an element of the group, it is its own inverse, thus [imath]ab=(ab)^{-1}[/imath].</br></br></br>It is given that every element is its own inverse, i.e if [imath]a[/imath] is an element in [imath]G[/imath] then its inverse (say [imath]a^{-1}[/imath] ) is  [imath]a[/imath]. Since G is a group [imath] ab \in G~~ \text{for a,b } \in G.[/imath]</br>Hence by hypothesis its inverse should be equal to [imath]ab[/imath].</br></br></br>
