A quick doubt on a Calculus problem involving inflection points</br></br>A problem asks to show whether the following is true or false:</br>If the graph of [imath]f[/imath] is concave upward in [imath](a,c)[/imath] and concave downward</br>  in [imath](c,b)[/imath], where [imath]a<c<b[/imath], then [imath]f[/imath] has a point on inflection at</br>  [imath]x=c[/imath].</br>I am pretty sure the statement is true, but how can I show it mathematically? Thanks very much in advance.</br></br>If [imath]f[/imath] continuous?</br>If you know that [imath]f[/imath] is twice differentiable, then you can show that [imath]f''[/imath], the second derivative, must have a zero in c.</br>Maybe try double differentiation, then show that [imath]f^{\prime\prime}[/imath] is positive just before [imath]c[/imath], negative just after [imath]c[/imath], and [imath]0[/imath] at [imath]c[/imath]. I know this probably seems stupidly obvious, but maybe that's all the question wants. Regardless, you would still need to invoke the definition of a point of inflection for your proof to be truly rigorous.</br>That's one common definition of an inflection point. What (other) definition are you using?</br>@daniels That's a terrible definition of inflection point, which unfortunately some calculus texts do use.  See e.g. Wikipedia for the more usual definition.</br></br>Consider [imath]f(x) = -\dfrac{1}{x} \,[/imath].  Note [imath]x=0[/imath] is not in the domain of [imath]f(x)[/imath]. </br>Now, first derivative is [imath]f'(x) = \dfrac{1}{x^2}[/imath] and second derivative is [imath]f''(x) = -\dfrac{2}{x^3}[/imath]. Take [imath]a=-1[/imath], [imath]c=0[/imath], and [imath]b=1[/imath]. All the conditions for the assumptions you state hold, but [imath]c=0[/imath] is not an inflection point because it is not in the domain.</br></br>By the way, what if we assume [imath]f[/imath] is continuous? Then I suppose that would be true, right? How would you show it? (Please let me know if I need to open another topic for this). Thank you very much.</br>@daniels: As some of the comments under the original question point out, it depends on the precise definition of the inflection point you are using. For example, one of your comments mention [imath]f''=0[/imath]. Just requiring [imath]f[/imath] being continuous would not be enough for this. Consider [imath]x^{4/3}[/imath] for which the second derivative will be undefined at [imath]x=0[/imath]. ... (cont'd: 1 of 2 comments)</br>... (cont'd 2 of 2 comments) According to Wikipedia, "inflection points are the points of the curve where the curvature changes its sign while a tangent exists". If we go with that definition, consider [imath]f(x)=x^{1/3}[/imath] which is continuous, but [imath]f'(x)=\frac{1}{3} x^{-2/3}[/imath] is undefined at [imath]x=0[/imath] (so tangent doesn't exist at [imath]x=0[/imath]) but with [imath]f''(x)=-\frac{2}{9 \, x^{5/3}}[/imath] switches signs to the left and the right of [imath]x=0[/imath]. Since tangent doesnt exist, according to the Wikipedia definition, [imath]x=0[/imath] is not an inflection point. By the way, [imath]f(x)=x^{1/3}[/imath] has what's called a "cusp" at [imath]x=0[/imath].</br></br>Take the function [imath]f [/imath] defined by</br>[imath]f (x)=\sqrt {x} \;\; [/imath]if[imath] \; 0 \leq x <1[/imath] and</br>[imath]f (x)=-\sqrt {-x}  \;\;[/imath]if [imath]\;-1 <x \leq 0[/imath]</br>it is not differentiable at [imath]x=0[/imath].</br>but</br>[imath]\forall x\in (0,1)  \;\; f''(x)<0[/imath] and</br>[imath]\forall x\in (-1,0)\;\; f''(x)>0[/imath]</br></br>[imath]x=0[/imath] still is an inflection point, so I am not sure what is the point that you mean to drive.</br>Not necessarily. The usual definition of an inflection point is one where the function changes concavity, see for example wikipedia or mathworld. The function is not required to be differentiable at that point.</br></br>Usually an inflection  point of a curve is defined as a point  where the concavity changes its sign and where there exists a tangent line.</br>With this definition we can have functions that change concavity at a point that is not an inflection point because we have not a tangent at this point, as :</br>[imath]f(x)=</br>\begin{cases}</br>x^2 \quad for\quad  x\le 0  \\ \sqrt{x} \quad for\quad  x>0 </br>\end {cases}[/imath]</br>But, if the function is twice differentiable at the point [imath]c[/imath] we are sure that a tangent  exists at this point , so it is a true inflection point.</br></br></br>
