{"text": "Show that this entire function is polynomial.\n\nLet [imath]f[/imath] be an entire function such that [imath] |f(z)| \\to \\infty[/imath] as [imath]|z| \\to \\infty[/imath]. Prove that [imath]f[/imath] is a polynomial.\n\n\nConsider the holomorphic function on [imath]\\mathbb{C}^*[/imath]\n[imath]\ng(z)=f\\left(\\frac{1}{z}\\right).\n[/imath]\nSo \n[imath]\n\\lim_{z\\rightarrow 0}\\;|g(z)|=+\\infty.\n[/imath]\nObviously, [imath]0[/imath] is not a removable singularity.\nNow by the Casorati-Weierstrass theorem, [imath]0[/imath] is not an essential singularity either. Indeed, take [imath]r>0[/imath] such that [imath]|g(z)|\\geq 1[/imath] for all [imath]0<|z|<r[/imath]. Then [imath]g(z\\;;\\;0<|z|<r\\})[/imath] is certainly not dense in [imath]\\mathbb{C}[/imath].\nEdit: As pointed out by @mrf, it is actually easy to see that this implies [imath]0[/imath] is a pole for [imath]g[/imath]. It suffices to use Riemann's theorem on removable singularities adequately. Indeed [imath]h(z)=1/g(z)[/imath] is holomorphic and bounded in some [imath]\\{z\\;;\\;0<|z|<r\\}[/imath] with limit [imath]0[/imath] at [imath]0[/imath], so [imath]0[/imath] is a removable singularity of [imath]h[/imath] and a zero of the holomorphic extension of [imath]h[/imath]. Factor [imath]h(z)=z^nk(z)[/imath] with [imath]k[/imath] holomorphic and [imath]k(0)\\neq 0[/imath]. The result follows. And this is indeed more elementary than Casorati-Weierstrass.\nSo keep the Casorati-Weierstrass argument for weaker assumptions such as the ones I mention below.\nSo [imath]0[/imath] must be a pole. Hence the Laurent series of [imath]g[/imath] at [imath]0[/imath] is of the form\n[imath]\ng(z)=\\frac{a_n}{z^n}+\\ldots+\\frac{a_1}{z}+a_0.\n[/imath]\nNote that there are no positive powers of [imath]z[/imath] because this comes from the power series of [imath]f[/imath].\nThe result follows clearly by going back to [imath]f[/imath]. \nEdit: Note the same proof works if we simply assume that [imath]f[/imath] is entire and there exist [imath]\\alpha>0[/imath] and [imath]M>0[/imath] such that\n[imath]\n|f(z)|\\geq \\alpha\\qquad \\forall |z|\\geq M.\n[/imath]\nOf course, there could be even weaker assumptions like there exists [imath]M>0[/imath] such that [imath]f(\\{z\\;;\\; |z|>M\\})[/imath] is not dense in [imath]\\mathbb{C}[/imath] and the proof would still work.\n\nThis is a good answer +1, but is it possible to do with more elementary tools than Casorati-Weierstrass?\n@user58512 Thanks. Maybe, since the assumption is much stronger than what is really needed to apply Casorati-Weierstrass. Let's wait and see.\nSince [imath]|g|\\to \\infty[/imath] as [imath]z\\to 0[/imath], we see that [imath]0[/imath] is a pole directly (without Weierstrass-Casorati).\n@Seirios Thanks for the edit, you made me understand that it was possible to do this. After six months...it was high time.\nOften this property is used as the very definition of pole, but even with other plausible definitions, it's straight-forward to see that an isolated singularity is a pole iff [imath]|f| \\to\\infty[/imath] at the point in question.\n\nHint: The set of zeroes of [imath]f[/imath] is bounded and discrete, hence finite and this allows us to find a polynomial [imath]p[/imath] such that [imath]f(z)=p(z)g(z)[/imath] for some entire function [imath]g\\colon \\mathbb C\\to\\mathbb C^\\times[/imath]. What scenarios can happen with [imath]g(z)[/imath] as [imath]z\\to\\infty[/imath]?\n\nIf a set of points is bounded and discrete, can you then conclude is finite? Any sequence that converges is bounded and discrete, and infinite, like [imath]\\sum_0^\\infty \\frac{1}{2^k}[/imath]\n@GitGud Yes thanks.\n@MyUserIsThis: Some people take discrete to mean closed and discrete for which the statement that boundedness implies finiteness is true. The set of zeroes of [imath]f[/imath] is clearly closed.\nHm, upon rereading I think that whoever upvoted me here should be ashamed :9\n\n", "url": "http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2222052/prove-that-f-is-a-polynomial"}
