{"text": "Asymptote to graph of solution to [imath]60y' = y[12 - y][/imath]\n\n[imath]60P'(t) = P(t)[12 - P(t)][/imath], and [imath]P(0) = 3[/imath]. What is the horizontal asymptote for the graph of the function [imath]P(t)[/imath]?  The answer is \"[imath]y = 12[/imath].\"  The answer is the same if the initial condition is [imath]20[/imath] or [imath]100[/imath].  What is the solution to the differential equation?\n\n\nLet [imath]y=P(t)[/imath]. Then \n[imath]\\begin{align}60y'=y(12-y)&\\implies\\frac{60}{y(12-y)}\\frac{dy}{dt}=1\\tag1\\\\\n\\int\\frac5y+\\frac{5}{12-y}dy&=\\int dt\\tag2\\\\\n5\\log y-5\\log(12-y)&=t+c\\tag3\\\\\n\\log\\frac{12-y}{y}&=-\\frac15t+c\\tag4\\\\\n12-y&=Aye^{-t/5}\\tag5\\\\\ny&=\\frac{12}{1+Ae^{-t/5}}\\tag6\\end{align}[/imath]\nAs [imath]t\\to\\infty[/imath], [imath]y\\to \\frac{12}{1+Ae^{-\"\\infty\"}}=\\frac{12}{1+0}=12.[/imath]\nAlso notice that the initial condition allows us to determine [imath]A[/imath], which has no affect on this asymptote, as you noted, since [imath]Ae^{-t/5}\\to0[/imath] as [imath]t\\to\\infty[/imath] regardless of [imath]A[/imath].\nSteps:\n[imath](1)[/imath] - Re-arrange differential equation\n[imath](2)[/imath] - Split into partial fractions, integral signs\n[imath](3)[/imath] - integrate\n[imath](4)[/imath] - log rules\n[imath](5)[/imath] and [imath](6)[/imath] - rearrange\n\nNice explanation!\nMy post was part a.) of a past AP Calculus test.  Part b.) is to find the value of the function at which the function is growing the fastest if P(0)=3.  The solution provided says \"half of the maximum population is when the population is growing the fastest, and lim P(t) = 12.  So, when the function value is 6, the function is growing the fastest.\"  That was it.\n@user74973 I am not sure about the method you mentioned. This is how I would do it. If [imath]P(0)=3[/imath], then [imath]A=3[/imath]. [imath]P(t)=\\frac{12}{1+3e^{-t/5}}\\implies P'(t)=\\frac{36e^{-t/5}}{5(1+3e^{-t/5})^2}\\implies P''(t)=-\\frac{36e^{-t/5}(1-3e^{-t/5})}{25(1+3e^{-t/5})^3}[/imath]  This is zero when [imath]e^{-t/5}=\\frac13\\implies t=5\\log 3[/imath].  Then [imath]P(5\\log3)=\\frac{12}{1+1}=6.[/imath]\nYes, this is the way I got the answer while waiting for your reply.  Thanks.\nYou have an error in your definition of [imath]P^{\\prime\\prime}[/imath].  The numerator should have 108 and not 36.  (I had supposed that [imath]P(0) = 1[/imath] when I defined [imath]P^{\\prime}[/imath] and [imath]P^{\\prime\\prime}[/imath].  This is a mistake.  In the post, I specify [imath]P(0) = 3[/imath].)\n\n", "url": "http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2266552/asymptote-to-graph-of-solution-to-60y-y12-y"}
