{"text": "Continuity w.r.t a norm \u2014 question about terms\n\nGiven a set of all continuous functions from the interval [imath][a,b][/imath] to the real numbers [imath]\\mathbb{R}[/imath], i.e. [imath]C([a,b],\\mathbb{R}).[/imath]\nLet [imath]G :C([a,b],\\mathbb{R}) \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R} , f \\mapsto \\max_{s \\in [a,b]}(f(s))[/imath]\nand\nLet [imath] \\lVert \\cdot \\rVert_{\\infty} :C([a,b],\\mathbb{R}) \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}, f \\mapsto \\lVert f \\rVert_{\\infty}:= \\max_{s \\in [a,b]}(|f(s)|)[/imath]\nShow that [imath]G[/imath] is continuous with respect to the norm [imath] \\lVert \\cdot \\rVert_{\\infty} [/imath].\nMy question hereto is: how should I understand the last sentence, specifically the part \"with respect to\"? Is it possible to apply the norm [imath] \\lVert \\cdot \\rVert_{\\infty} [/imath] to [imath]G[/imath], and if so, what would the mapping look like? \nBoth [imath]G[/imath] and  [imath] \\lVert \\cdot \\rVert_{\\infty} [/imath] are maps from [imath]C([a,b],\\mathbb{R}) \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}[/imath], hence I am unsure of how to use [imath]G[/imath] and  [imath] \\lVert \\cdot \\rVert_{\\infty} [/imath] together. To do it as \"[imath] \\lVert G\\rVert_{\\infty} [/imath]\" is not intuitive to me. \nAny help is appreciated. Oh, and thanks for your considerations, smart mathematicians!\n\n\nWe are to take the distance between two functions [imath]f,g[/imath] to be [imath]\\|f-g\\|_\\infty.[/imath] That is implied by the mention of continuity \"with respect to\" that norm.\nThe distance between two real numbers [imath]a,b[/imath] is [imath]|a-b|.[/imath]\n\"Continuity\" of [imath]G[/imath] means:\n\\begin{align}\n& \\text{For every member } f \\text{ of the domain } C([a,b],\\mathbb{R}), \\\\[5pt]\n& \\text{for every number } \\varepsilon>0 \\text{ (no matter how small)}, \\\\[5pt]\n& \\text{there is some number } \\delta>0 \\text{ so small that whenever} \\\\[5pt]\n& g \\text{ is any member of the domain } C([a,b], \\mathbb R) \\text{ for which} \\\\[5pt]\n& \\text{the distance between } f \\text{ and } g \\text{ is less than } \\delta, \\\\[5pt]\n& \\text{the distance between } G(f) \\text{ and } G(g) \\text{ is less than } \\varepsilon.\n\\end{align}\nMore tersely,\n\\begin{align}\n\\forall f\\in C([a,b],\\mathbb R)\\ \\forall \\varepsilon > 0\\  \\exists\\delta > 0 & \\  \\forall g\\in C([a,b],\\mathbb R)\\\\[10pt]\n& \\Big( \\text{if } \\underbrace{\\|f-g\\|_\\infty} < \\delta \\text{ then } \\underbrace{|G(f) - G(g)|}<\\varepsilon \\Big).\n\\end{align}\nThe two [imath]\\underbrace{\\text{underbraces}}[/imath] correspond to the metric on the domain and the metric on the codomain.\nTo prove this, you will of course need the definition of [imath]G[/imath]. And some basic inequalities.\n\nI have switched [imath]\\delta[/imath] with [imath]\\varepsilon[/imath] to the correct form.\nHi Michael. This answered my question, aswell as gave me some extra intuition on norms and what they actually are. Thanks a lot!\n\nIn a domain of [imath]G[/imath] we have the [imath]\\|\\cdot\\|_{\\infty}[/imath] norm, so continuity wrt. this norm means that if [imath]\\|f_n-f\\|_{\\infty}\\to 0[/imath] (as [imath]n\\to\\infty[/imath]) then [imath]|G(f_n)-G(f)|\\to 0[/imath]. Unfortunately our functional [imath]G[/imath] is not linear because the maximum property loses after multiplying by negative scalars. So, it is not enough to check continuity at [imath]0[/imath]-function.\n\nHi szw1710. Thank you for your answer. Michael gave me the explanation that I needed to understand the subject. Nevertheless, you deserve a thumbs up for taking your time. Cheers\n\n", "url": "http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2259552/continuity-w-r-t-a-norm-question-about-terms"}
