Let [imath]r[/imath] and [imath]R[/imath] be two positive real numbers, with [imath]R > r[/imath] .  Show that for every [imath]a, b \\in B (0, r )[/imath], there exists a diffeomorphism [imath]f[/imath] of [imath]\\mathbb{R}^n[/imath] such that [imath]f(a) = b , f(x)= x[/imath] for [imath]|| x || > R[/imath] and [imath]f ^{*}\\omega_{0} = \\omega_{0}[/imath].\nOne-dimensional case is fine. I have tried to extend that idea to the higher dimensional case. I have an exam. I don't understand how to construct [imath]f[/imath]. Hints are welcomed. Can anyone please help me?\n\nWhen you write, \"I have an exam\", do you mean this question is an exam question?\nIt's a potential problem for the exam.\n\n[imath]\\newcommand{\\Reals}{\\mathbf{R}}[/imath]Hint: Let [imath](r, \\theta)[/imath] denote polar coordinates on [imath]\\Reals^{2}[/imath].
