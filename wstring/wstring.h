/*
 * Many of Câ€™s string functions are locale-independent
 * and they just look at zero-terminated byte sequences:
 * strcpy strncpy strcat strncat
 * strcmp strncmp strdup strchr strrchr
 * strcspn strspn strpbrk strstr strtok
 *
 * Some of these (e.g. strcpy) can equally be used for
 * single-byte (ISO 8859-1) and multi-byte (UTF-8)
 * encoded character sets, as they need no notion of
 * how many byte long a character is, while others
 * (e.g., strchr) depend on one character being encoded
 * in a single char value and are of less use for UTF-8
 * (strchr still works fine if you just search for an
 * ASCII character in a UTF-8 string).
