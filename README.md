Approach0 is a math-aware search engine.

Math search can be helpful in math Q&A websites: Assume you are doing a tough
question on your math homework, you type in search box the exact question from
your textbook, after a second (maybe too much) you get all the similar questions
that somebody has already asked about, they are perhaps answered!
