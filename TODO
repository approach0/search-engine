Top priority:
* delta compression & posting file compression
* blob-index (libz compress)

Want to implement:
* search: concept search (horse == Pony) and phrase&proximity search
* spell checking & 3-gram input suggestion
* query correction ("do you mean XXX")

Do it when time is allowed:
* malloc hook
* faster Chinese tokenizer
* oprtr decompose (when no search result is found)
* faster math-index/subpath-set
* breadth-first dir-merge
* in mnc_score, compare father-to-root hash
